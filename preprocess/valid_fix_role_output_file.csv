Follow-up of chronic problems.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Brian White is a 58-year-old male with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure and hypertension, who presents today for follow-up of his chronic problems.

The patient states he has been feeling out of sorts lately. He is not sure if it is due to the change in the seasons or due to performing lots of projects and some construction on his home. He reports fatigue and lightheadedness. This has been going on for about 5 weeks. While exerting energy, he has experienced some shortness of breath and chest cramps. The patient also notes a slight cough, but he is not sure if it is just the change in seasons.

He feels bloated every once in a while. His diet has been a little bit of a struggle. They had construction on their kitchen begin over Labor Day weekend, and have been eating less healthy food as a result.

Regarding his heart failure, he has been pretty good with his salt intake. He has been pretty good about his diet since the last year and is staying on top of that as much as possible. The patient has continued to utilize Lasix daily.

For his hypertension, this has been well controlled with lisinopril 20 mg a day. He has continued to monitor his blood pressure regularly.

The patient did the review of systems sheet when he checked in. He denies weight gain, swelling in the lower extremities, fevers, chills, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional: Endorses fatigue. Denies fevers, chills, or weight loss.
• Cardiovascular: Endorses chest pain or dyspnea on exertion.
• Respiratory: Endorses cough and shortness of breath.
• Gastrointestinal: Endorses bloating.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Neck: JVD 8 cm.
• Respiratory: Rales bilateral bases.
• Cardiovascular: 3/6 systolic ejection murmur.
• Musculoskeletal: 1+ pitting edema bilateral lower extremities.

RESULTS

X-ray of the chest demonstrates a mild amount of fluid in the lungs.

Echocardiogram demonstrates decreased ejection fraction of 45% and mild mitral regurgitation.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Brian White is a 58-year-old male with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure and hypertension, who presents today for follow up of his chronic problems.

Congestive heart failure.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient reports increased fatigue, dizziness, and chest discomfort on exertion. He also exhibits some jugular venous distention, lung base crackles, and lower extremity edema on exam today. He has been compliant with his current medications but admits to dietary indiscretion lately. His recent echocardiogram demonstrated a reduced ejection fraction of 45%, as well as mitral regurgitation.
• Additional Testing: We will order a repeat echocardiogram.
• Medical Treatment: Increase Lasix to 80 mg daily.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to monitor and record his daily weight and report those to me via the patient portal. He will contact me should he continue to experience any dyspnea.

Hypertension.
• Medical Reasoning: This is well controlled based on home monitoring.
• Medical Treatment: Continue lisinopril 20 mg daily.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised him to monitor and record his blood pressures at home and report these to me via the patient portal.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","[doctor] hi , brian . how are you ?

[doctor] and you've been taking a little bit of ice , uh , putting some ice on it , and has n't really helped and some ibuprofen . is that right ?
[patient] that's right . yeah .
[doctor] okay , let's review your past history for a second . it looks like , uh , do you have any other past medical history ?
[patient] uh , afib .
[doctor] okay , and are you taking any medications for that ?
[patient] yeah , i am . um , begins with a d.
[doctor] uh , digoxin ?
[patient] that's it . yeah , that's it .
[doctor] okay , all right . how about any surgeries in the past ?
[patient] i have had a nose job .
[doctor] all right . um , let's do your exam , okay ? so is it tender ... where is it mostly tender right now ?
[patient] right on the inside of my knee . right here .
[doctor] all right , so if i bend your knee forward , does that seem to hurt ?
[patient] yes , that hurts .
[doctor] all right , how about if i twist it a little bit that way .
[patient] that hurts a lot .
[doctor] okay , okay . and how about down here ? do you feel me touch you down here ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] all right . any other pain down here in your calves ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] no , okay . so on exam you do have some tenderness over the medial portion of your knee over the medial meniscus area . uh , there is no , uh , there is a little bit of tenderness when i flex your , uh , when i , uh , uh , do some valgus stressing on your , on your leg . um , you have normal sensation . so let's take a look at your x-rays .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay . hey dragon , show me the x-rays . so looking at the x-ray , um , of your left knee , uh , it appears to be there's no fractures there right now . i do n't see any , uh , there's a little bit of , uh , fluid , uh , but there is no , uh , there's no , um , fracture or there's no dislocation . everything else seems to be lined up properly , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so in summary after my exam , uh , looking at your knee , uh , on the x-ray and your exam , you have some tenderness over the medial meniscus , so i think you have probably an acute medial meniscus sprain right now or strain . uh , at this point , my recommendation would be to put you in a knee brace , uh , and we'll go ahead and have you use some crutches temporarily for the next couple days . we'll have you come back in about a week and see how you're doing , and if it's not better , we'll get an mri at that time .

HPI:

Ms. Thompson is a 43-year-old female who presents today for an evaluation of right knee pain.

Examination of the right knee shows pain with flexion. Tenderness over the medial joint line. No pain in the calf. Pain with valgus stress. Sensation is intact.

RESULTS

X-rays of the right knee show no obvious signs of acute fracture or dislocation. Mild effusion is noted.

PLAN

At this point, I discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with the patient. I have recommended a knee brace. She will take Motrin 800 mg, every 6 hours with food, for two weeks. She will use crutches for the next couple of days. She will follow up with me in 1 week for a repeat evaluation. If she is not better at that time, we will obtain an MRI. All questions were answered.

[doctor] . blood pressure go up . let's look at the readings .
[doctor] hey dragon ? show me the blood pressure readings .
[doctor] yeah ... yeah you know they do run a little bit on the high side , so we'll have to address that as well .

Back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Logan Walker is a 58-year-old male with a past medical history significant for diabetes type 2, hypertension, and osteoarthritis, who presents today with back pain.

Mr. Walker reports that he was helping his daughter move some heavy equipment and lifted some heavy boxes a little too quickly on Saturday. He thought he heard a pop when he moved and he had to lie down for about an hour before his pain resolved. He has had stiffness ever since. The pain is located in his lower back. He took Tylenol, ibuprofen, and used Icy Hot on the area, but it did not seem to help. The patient endorses some tingling in his toes on his right foot, which resolved Sunday afternoon. He finds it difficult to find a comfortable position to sleep at night, and he tends to lie on his right side, which seems to help a little bit.

Regarding his diabetes type 2, Mr. Walker reports that he has not cooked a meal at home in weeks, due to travel. He notes that his diet has not been great, and he thinks he needs to eat clean for a couple of weeks.

He monitors his blood pressure at home and it is under control for the most part.

Regarding his osteoarthritis, Mr. Walker reports occasional aggravation of his knee when he runs too much or lifts boxes that are too heavy.

Iron deficiency anemia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mrs. Christina Cooper is a 65-year-old female who presents with a long-history of iron deficiency anemia.

The patient reports she has been living with anemia since she was 13 years old. She attempted to donate blood on 12/2019 but was unable to due to her anemia. She has a history of heavy menstruation and a hysterectomy in 1996. She completed a colonoscopy 5-6 years ago with nonsignificant findings. She denies having a pacemaker, defibrillator, sleep apnea, or using oxygen.

Mrs. Cooper reports a myriad of symptoms, stating she feels fatigued often during the day, feverish with chills at times, and during activity feels she cannot catch her breath and some wheezing is present. She has been having some headaches which is uncommon for her. Additionally, she is noticing tingling sensations, cold sensitivity, and her anxiety and depression have worsened.

ASSESSMENT

• Iron deficiency anemia

Mrs. Cooper is a 65-year-old female who was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia in 12/2019 and was unable to donate blood. Her follow-up blood work in 01/2020 revealed a low hemoglobin, stable hematocrit, and normal iron labs, although, ferritin was low. She has been taking ferrous sulfate 325 mg by mouth.

PLAN

I have asked her to continue each ferrous sulfate dose with vitamin C found in orange juice for the next 12 weeks then recheck CBC, iron ferritin, B-12, and folate. A referral was sent for her to see a hematologist. We will plan for EGD and colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or GI bleed. If this is inconclusive, capsule endoscopy can be considered.

INSTRUCTIONS

Schedule upper endoscopy, colonoscopy and appointment with hematologist. Return to the clinic if symptoms worsen.","[doctor] today i am seeing christina coop . h date of birth is 07/01/1954 .  , ms. coop is a new patient who was refred by diane nelson for a long-standing iron deficiency anemia .

[doctor] worked out for worsening headaches was initiated with brain mri and serology where pituitary lesion was incidentally discovered . i personally reviewed the labs dated 3/3/21 including cbc , unes , uh , coagulation , and crp . all were normal . pituitary hormone profile demonstrates a low tsh , all other results were normal . um , i personally reviewed pertinent radiology studies including mri for the brain with contrast from 3/4/21 . the mri reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm . the ventricles are normal in size and no other abnormalities are lo- are noted .
[doctor] hello , mr . ward . nice to meet you . i'm dr. flores .
[patient] hi , doc . nice to meet you .
[doctor] i was just reviewing your records from dr. howard and he's referred you because the workup for headaches revealed a mass on your pituitary gland . i did review your mri images and you have a significant mass there . can you tell me about the issues you've been experiencing ?
[patient] yeah sure . so i'm really getting fed up with these headaches . i've been trying my best to deal with them but they've been going on for months now and i'm really struggling .
[doctor] where are the headaches located and how would you describe that pain ?
[patient] located behind my eyes . it's like a dull nagging ache .

[doctor] all right , mr. ward . i'm going to review these pictures from the mri with you . um , now this appears to be a benign pituitary adenoma , but there's no way to be sure without sending the removed adenoma to pathology to make the diagnosis , which we will do . um , here you can see it's a well defined mass . and it's pressing right here on what we call the optic chiasm . and today when i was having you look at my fingers , you could n't see them off to the sides , that's what we call bitemporal hemianopia . and explains why you have been bumping into door frames .
[patient] yeah i never noticed that i could n't see out of the side until you did that test , and you closed one eye with both eyes . i really could n't tell .
[doctor] no because you're having this vision loss from the mass compressing the optic chiasm , the only option we have is to do surgery .
[patient] okay , i understand . do you think i'll regain my vision ?
[doctor] well there's no guarantees , but it is a possibility . i'm gon na refer you to the eye doctor for a full exam and they'll do what's called visual field test . this will map our your peripheral vision or side vision prior to surgery . and we can monitor after surgery to see if your vision is improving .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] and let's discuss the surgery a little more . um , we would do what's called a transsphenoidal approach to do the surgery . this is minimally invasive and we go through the sphenoid sinus . there are some risks i have to inform you of . uh , risk of anesthesia including but not limited to the risk of heart attack , stroke , and death . risk of surgery include infection , need for further surgery , wound issues such as spinal fluid leak or infection , uh , which may require long , prolonged hospitalization or additional procedure . uh , seizure , stroke , permanent numbness , weakness , difficulty speaking , or even death .

Pituitary lesion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Bruce Ward is a 52-year-old male with a pituitary lesion. The patient is seen in consultation at the request of Dr. Henry Howard for possible surgical intervention.

The patient presented to his primary care provider, Dr. Howard, on 03/01/2021 complaining of worsening headaches over the past few months. He denied any trouble with headaches in the past. Further work up of headaches with MRI of the brain revealed the pituitary lesion.

Mr. Ward reports headaches started about 3 months ago, at which point they were around 3 out of 10 in severity. They have gradually worsened over time and now he rates them at about 6/10. The headaches do tend to be worse in the morning and feel like a dull ache behind the eyes. They tend to last a few hours at a time, and nothing makes them particularly worse or better. Tylenol failed to improve headaches.

The patient endorses that recently he has been bumping into door frames, but no obvious problems with his balance or vision. He denies any recent sickness or feeling sick and negative for fever, rash, paresthesia, weakness, neck stiffness, or syncope.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Newly diagnosed pituitary lesion.

FAMILY HISTORY

No known family history; adopted.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Employment Status: Works as a computer programmer.
Marital Status: Married for 25 years.
Living Arrangement: Lives with wife, recently purchased a new house.
Alcohol Use: None.
Tobacco Use: Non-smoker.
Recreational Drugs: None.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neurological
Patient alert, oriented to person, place, and time, affect appropriate and speech fluent. Cranial nerve examination grossly intact. No focal motor or sensory deficit in the upper or lower extremities.

Eyes
Visual acuity and eye movements are normal. Pupils are equal and reactive. Visual field testing reveals bitemporal hemianopia. Color vision is normal.

RESULTS

Labs reviewed, 03/03/2021: CBC, U&Es, coagulation, and CRP are all normal. Pituitary hormone profile demonstrates a low TSH, all other results were normal.

Independent review and interpretation of MRI brain, 03/04/2021: The MRI reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm. The ventricles are normal in size and no other abnormalities are noted.

ASSESSMENT

• Pituitary adenoma
• Bitemporal hemianopia

Mr. Ward is a very pleasant 52-year-old male who has a benign appearing pituitary adenoma discovered on work up for worsening headaches. There is clinical and radiographical evidence of optic chiasmal compression, examination today revealed a bitemporal hemianopia. Radiographically this appears to be a benign pituitary adenoma but that there was no way to be sure without a pathological diagnosis. Surgical intervention to excise and decompress the pituitary fossa is indicated given optic chiasmal compression.

PLAN

Pituitary adenoma.
We discussed the general indications for surgical intervention. The risks, benefits to trans-sphenoidal resection were explained to the patient. The risks of anesthesia including but not limited to the risks of heart attack, stroke, and death. The risks of surgery including infection, need for further surgery, wound issues (such as spinal fluid leak or infection) which may require prolonged hospitalization or additional procedure, seizure, stroke, permanent numbness, weakness, difficulty speaking, or death. The patient voiced understanding and wishes to proceed with trans-sphenoidal resection of the adenoma.

Bitemporal hemianopia.
We will have the patient scheduled this week to have visual field testing with ophthalmology. The preoperative visual field will serve as baseline for comparison of postoperative visual field testing to monitor for improvement in the bitemporal hemianopia. Additionally, we discussed that unfortunately no guarantees could be given that his vision would return.

INSTRUCTIONS

• Refer to ophthalmology for baseline visual field testing.
• Schedule trans-sphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma.

[patient] i'd like to hold off on the egd and wait to see if i have more symptoms .
[doctor] that sounds good . um , so you can call the office if you have any additional episodes of pain or any other symptoms you're concerned about . if that happens , we'll get you scheduled for an egd to take a look . if not , you can follow up with me ... follow up with me as needed for any other gi complaints .

Esophagitis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Betty Hill is a 53 y.o. female who presents to clinic today for a new patient evaluation of suspected esophagitis. The patient was referred from the emergency department where she was seen in early 10/2020 following 4 days of chest pain. The pain has resolved but she kept this appointment to discuss the original 4-day episode.

The patient describes her chest pain in early 10/2020 as sharp and localized behind the sternum. She states that it felt like a heart attack and the onset was sudden. The pain was exacerbated by eating and accompanied by dysphagia. The patient is not able to say whether she had heartburn as she has never experienced heartburn before and is unsure what it feels like. When asked about potential triggers, the patient identifies that she was experiencing a lot of stress at that time due to a job transition. She was able to tolerate the chest pain and dysphagia for 4 days but reports that nothing she tried relieved her symptoms. She then presented to the emergency department and underwent labs and EKG. All results came back normal from these tests. She was not prescribed any medications in the emergency department but was given a referral to me for suspected esophagitis. Her chest pain and dysphagia resolved spontaneously approximately 3 days after her emergency department visit and has not recurred.

The patient denies unintentional weight loss, weight gain, abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea. She states she is trying to lose weight.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Uterine fibroids.
Anemia.

Surgical
Cholecystectomy.

FAMILY HISTORY

None reported.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Cardiovascular:  Positive for chest pain.
• Gastrointestinal:  Positive for difficulty swallowing.
• Psychiatric:  Positive for stress.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Gastrointestinal
Mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants.

RESULTS

The patient’s emergency department records from her 10/2020 visit were reviewed, including the normal cardiac workup.

ASSESSMENT

The patient presents today following a visit to the emergency department in early 10/2020 for 4-days of sharp chest pain, made worse by eating, and dysphagia. Notably, the patient was experiencing higher levels of stress than normal for her at that time due to a job transition. Her cardiac evaluation in the emergency department was normal and she was referred to me for suspected esophagitis. The patient’s pain and associated dysphagia spontaneously resolved 3 days after her emergency department visit and has not recurred. Possible etiologies of her chest pain and dysphagia include GERD, dyspepsia, esophagitis, musculoskeletal etiologies, and anxiety. Based on her history today, I suspect she had an anxiety attack related to her job transition, plus or minus a contribution from musculoskeletal etiologies.

Non-cardiac chest pain.

Suspected etiology of anxiety with or without underlying musculoskeletal etiology.

PLAN

• We discussed the role of an EGD in evaluating her prior symptoms. Given her current asymptomatic status, I am comfortable foregoing the EGD for now in lieu of continued monitoring for symptom recurrence. The patient agreed to notify my office if her symptoms return at which time, we could schedule the EGD. The patient is agreeable to this plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

• Self-monitor for symptom recurrence and notify my office if this occurs.
• Follow up as needed.","[doctor] next is betty hill ,  , date of birth is 2/21/1968 . she has a past medical history of utine fibroids and anemia . she's a new patient with a refral from the  of esophagitis .  , i reviewed our records from the  , including the normal cardiac workup , and we are about to go in and see h now . good morning . you miss hill ?

[patient_guest] hi .
[doctor] i'm dr. evelyn , one of the kidney doctors . it's good to meet you guys .
[patient_guest] it's nice to meet you also .
[doctor] yeah . so i was reading about this syndrome that i actually have never heard of .
[patient_guest] yeah , me too .
[doctor] i do n't think it's very common .
[patient_guest] definitely not . it's c- pretty rare .
[doctor] so-
[doctor] can you start at the beginning ? i know she's a twin , so are these your first two babies ?
[patient_guest] no , i have a son also who is nine . he also has autism .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] and when the twins were born , katherine , she was about 4 pounds , 8 ounces . and her twin was a bit smaller , at 3 pounds , 13 ounces .
[patient_guest] katherine , she was doing fine . she just had problems with eating , where she would stop breathing when she was eating .
[doctor] like preemie type stuff ?
[patient_guest] uh- . yeah . she just had a hard time regulating her temperature , but she did fine . she does have a gi doctor , because she has reflex really bad . she also had a dietician , who told us to take her off cow's milk . which we did . and then she has seen an allergist , and also a neurologist ... who diagnosed her with this syndrome , because she still does n't walk and she was n't sitting by herself a year old .
[doctor] yeah .
[patient_guest] but so now she is crawling and she is trying to take steps , so think she's doing pretty good .
[doctor] good . is she in therapy ?
[patient_guest] she is in therapy . she's in feeding therapy , occupational therapy , and also physical therapy .
[doctor] awesome . okay .
[patient_guest] and we also have speech therapy , who is going to be starting within the next couple of weeks .
[doctor] that's great .
[patient_guest] so , she has a lot of therapies . we have also seen an orthopedic and an ophthalmologist . i can never say that . we have seen everything , really .
[doctor] and audiology too , right ?
[patient_guest] yes .
[doctor] yeah , wow. .
[patient_guest] yeah , it has definitely been a whirlwind of stuff . when we saw the geneticist , she told us that sometimes people with this syndrome , they have trouble with their kidneys . that they might actually fuse into one . she also said sometimes they have problems with their legs , so that was why we saw ortho .
[doctor] okay . okay .
[patient_guest] so we have seen everybody , really . we are just here to make sure that her kidneys are looking good right now .
[doctor] yeah , okay . so , um , tell me about how many wet diapers she has in a 24 hour period ?
[patient_guest] she has a lot .
[doctor] so like normal 8 to 10 , or like 20 ?
[patient_guest] yeah , it's around 8 to 10 .
[doctor] okay . great .
[patient_guest] yeah , she seems to pee a lot , and it feels like she drinks a lot too .
[doctor] that's perfect .
[patient_guest] and she used to only drink milk , and then i took her off dairy milk . so when i say milk , i actually mean , you know , ripple pea protein milk .
[doctor] sure , yeah .
[patient_guest] so i give her that milk , water now that she's used to it , and sometimes water with just a little bit of juice . so i do feel like she's drinking a lot better now .
[doctor] that's great . and she's how old now ?
[patient_guest] she'll be two mo- two next month .
[doctor] okay . is her twin a boy or a girl ?
[patient_guest] she's a girl .

[doctor] all right . is she bigger than her or the same size ?
[patient_guest] they're about the same size . they're able to wear the same clothes , so ...
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] i do n't even think she's a pound hav- heavier , actually .
[doctor] yeah . yeah .
[patient_guest] but she is a little bit taller than her ... um , katherine . she's just sh- a little shorter and chunkier , but i think that's a part of her syndrome .
[doctor] yeah . yeah , i was reading all the things associated with the syndrome . it sounds like we're looking for continual- congenital anomalies wi- of the kidney and urinary tract . which is basically something is wrong with the plumbing .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] so the only way to know that , is to do a kidney ultrasound .
[patient_guest] okay , that sounds okay .
[doctor] okay . let me put that into the system , and then downstairs they can do the ultrasound .
[patient_guest] all right , thank you .
[doctor] okay , yeah . where do you all live ?
[patient_guest] uh , we live in dallas .
[doctor] okay . anybody in the family with kidney failure , dialysis or transplant ?
[patient_guest] no .
[doctor] okay . so let's get your ultrasound done , and we'll see how it goes .
[patient_guest] all right , that sounds good .
[doctor] all right . let me take a quick look at her .
[patient_guest] sure .
[doctor] all right . please use my physical exam template . um , i wan na take a quick listen to her heart and lungs . i'll look in her ears too . and she can sit , she can just sit on your lap .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] all right . that's it .
[patient_guest] all right , that was n't too bad .
[doctor] hmm . so , let's complete the ultrasound today . i'll call you with the results . if it's normal , you wo n't need to see me again , but if it's abnormal , you can see me in kennesaw .
[patient_guest] okay , that sounds good .

Renal screening tests.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Katherine Lopez is a 22-month-old female, born at 34 weeks +3 days gestation, diagnosed with the rare Smith-Magenis syndrome and associated global developmental delays. She was referred to nephrology by genetics who recommended renal screening tests. At birth, the patient weighed 4 pounds 8 ounces, exhibited difficulties during eating where she would stop breathing, and challenges regulating her body temperature; determined to be typical issues associated with premature birth. The patient has seen many specialists, including GI for severe reflux, a dietitian who recommended discontinuing consumption of cow’s milk, and a neurologist who diagnosed her with Smith-Magenis syndrome. Additionally, she has been seen by a geneticist, orthopedist, ophthalmologist, and audiologist. The patient is not ambulatory, did not sit up unassisted until 1 years old, and is currently crawling and attempting to take steps. She will be starting speech therapy in the next few weeks, and currently she is in occupational, feeding, and physical therapy. The geneticist informed the patient's mother that patients with Smith-Magenis syndrome usually have kidney issues where “the kidneys fuse into one” and issues with their legs.

The patient has approximately 8 to 10 wet diapers in a 24-hour period. Her mother notes that she is doing better with drinking fluids and she urinates “a lot”. The patient drinks Ripple Pea Protein milk instead of cow’s milk, water and water mixed with a small amount of juice. Her twin sister is approximately the same size, and their weight is essentially the same, she is healthy, and the mom denies any known health concerns or diagnoses. The mom states that Katherine is shorter and seems chubbier related to her syndrome. She also has a 9-year-old brother who is diagnosed with autism.

aci,D2N077,"[doctor] hey diana it's good to see you in here so i see that you injured your wrist could you tell me a bit about what happened
[patient] yeah i was walking up and down the stairs i was doing my laundry and i slipped and i tried to catch myself and i put my arms out to catch myself and then all of a sudden i just my wrist started to hurt real bad and it got real swollen
[doctor] wow okay so which wrist are we talking about left or right
[patient] it's my right one of course
[doctor] okay and then have you ever injured this arm before
[patient] no i have not
[doctor] okay alright so on a scale of one to ten how severe is the pain
[patient] gosh it's like a nine
[doctor] wow okay have you done anything to ease it
[patient] yeah i did the ice thing i put ice on it and then i you know i even i have a ace wrap at home i try to do that
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and then i took some ibuprofen but it helps a little bit but it's just it's it's just not right
[doctor] okay
[patient] really
[doctor] yeah okay have you sorry i'm trying to think how long ago did this injury happen
[patient] this happened yesterday morning
[doctor] okay
[patient] maybe just you know i just bumped it but
[doctor] okay
[patient] it's just not it's really bad
[doctor] okay no i understand okay so i'm going so you said you were doing laundry
[patient] yes i had my back hit my basket and for some reason this cold started to kinda fall out a little bit i was trying to catch it i missed a step and i just totally
[doctor] okay alright any does the pain extend anywhere
[patient] no not really
[doctor] okay
[patient] it's just really along my wrist
[doctor] okay any numbness any tingling
[patient] a little one and one ca n't tell if it's just because of the swelling in my wrist but just i can like i can feel it my fingers still
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] but just maybe a little bit of tingling
[doctor] okay alright and are you so so okay i'm gon na think on this but in the meantime i'm gon na do my physical exam alright
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay so you know looking at your looking at your head and your neck i do n't appreciate any like adenopathy no thyromegaly no no carotid bruit looking at your listening to your heart i do n't appreciate any murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally your lower legs you have palpable pulses no lower edema your shoulders every like your upper extremities i see normal range of movement with your right wrist let's go ahead and focus on it so when i push on the inside here does it hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay
[patient] it does
[doctor] and what about the outside does that hurt as well
[patient] yeah it does
[doctor] are you able to move your wrist towards your arm like
[patient] not without extreme pain
[doctor] okay so pain on flexion what about extension when you pick your wrist up
[patient] yeah i have a hard time doing that actually
[doctor] alright what about we're gon na go ahead and hold your arm like straight like flat and then try and move it sideways does radial deviation hurt
[patient] yeah
[doctor] alright and then lateral as well
[patient] yeah it's really hard to move any direction of this hand for some reason
[doctor] alright so wrist abduction adduction positive for pain on movement are you able to make a fist
[patient] hmmm yeah a little bit but i ca n't do it really tight
[doctor] okay alright okay so i'm just gon na go ahead and feel on your fingers really quickly alright metacarpals intact noticed some obvious swelling ecchymosis obvious swelling and bruising tenderness on palpation throughout there is evidence of potential fracture feeling some bony crepitus alright so this pain is it like chronic i wanted to ask you
[patient] yeah i would say it kinda goes away when i take that ibuprofen but for the most part i feel it i feel it there and it it's just really really bad when i move it all
[doctor] okay so when you like is there a position either hurts less or hurts more like say if your arm is raised and elevated over your head does it hurt more or is it just best to keep it like down
[patient] it's good if i keep it a little bit above my like a little i guess a little bit like around my like just a regular level like if you're typing or something and then i just put it on a pillow and i just let it stay straight like i feel better
[doctor] okay yeah no i do n't think i understand completely okay so i took a look at your vitals and your blood pressure is a little elevated but honestly that's probably to do with the pain right our body can respond to pain in that way we are looking at like a hundred and forty over over seventy it's not anything crazy but something to mention i see that your heart rate is also a little elevated at like about like eighty beats a minute you are not running a fever so that's great look at ninety ninety seven . two your respiratory rate is pretty normal at like twenty so before we came in i i know that we had you do an x-ray and i'm sure that that was a bit more painful because we had to do so many manipulations but i do wan na note that you are positive for what we call a colles' fracture what that means is that the joints between your wrist like the bones between your wrist that there there is evidence of a a fracture and we are gon na have to treat it a little conservatively at first and then consider some of the options options that are available to us so for your primary diagnosis of a colles' fracture we are going to give you a thumb spica for today and that's going to
[patient] i'm sorry
[doctor] pardon what
[patient] a what
[doctor] we're gon na brace you we're gon na give you a brace
[patient] okay thank you
[doctor] sorry no problem sorry yeah not a thumb spica we're gon na brace your arm and you're gon na have that we we have a couple of options but i think the best course of action is gon na be for surgery we will in the meantime give you pain medication i wan na put you on fifty milligrams of ultram every six hours and then i also wan na get you on get you into physical therapy a few weeks after surgery this is gon na be just a normal procedure you will be in for an overnight stay but after that once we assess and make sure that everything is good you'll be able to go home okay
[patient] when do i have to have the surgery
[doctor] we would like it to happen as quickly as possible you know your body is a wonderful miracle and it's going to start trying to heal on it's own what we need to do is get your wrist straight and then like put screws in to make sure that we hold it in place or else it could like heal and malform
[patient] okay

Right wrist injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Diana Scott is a pleasant 61-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right wrist injury. The patient sustained this injury yesterday morning, 05/12/2022, when she slipped on the stairs while carrying a laundry basket. She states she tried to catch herself with her arms outstretched. The patient reports an immediate onset of pain and swelling in her right wrist. She denies any previous injuries to her right arm. The patient rates her pain level as a 9/10. Her pain is aggravated by movement. The patient also reports numbness and tingling in her fingers. She has been icing and wrapping her right wrist with an ACE wrap. The patient has also been taking ibuprofen, which provides some relief. She notes fully extending her arm while resting it on a pillow alleviates some of her pain as well.

The patient is going on vacation in 1 month.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Neurological: Reports numbness and tingling to the digits of the right hand.

VITALS

Blood Pressure: Elevated at 140/70 mmHg.
Heart Rate: 80 beats per minute.

Body Temperature: 97.2 degrees F.
HEAD: Normocephalic
NECK: No swelling noted
CV: No bilateral lower extremity edema. No carotid bruit. No murmurs, gallops or rubs heard during auscultation of the heart. Palpabale pulses to the bilateral lower extremities.
RESPIRATORY: Normal respiratory effort no respiratory distress. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
GI/GU: Non-distended
BACK: No evidence of trauma or deformity
NECK: No adenopathy. No thyromegaly.
MSK: Examination of the right wrist: Limited range of movement. Tenderness to palpation. Pain on flexion and extension. Pain with radial deviation and lateral deviation. Pain with wrist abduction and adduction. The metacarpals are intact. Obvious swelling and bruising. Tenderness on palpation throughout. There is evidence of potential fracture feeling and bony crepitus.

RESULTS

X-rays of the right wrist were taken today. These reveal the fracture appears extra-articular and proximal to the radioulnar joint. Dorsal angulation of the distal fracture fragment is present to a variable degree. Dorsal angulation is severe, presenting with a dinner fork deformity. An ulnar styloid fracture is present.

ASSESSMENT

Right wrist Colles fracture.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have discussed with the patient that her x-rays revealed a right wrist Colles fracture. We discussed treatment options and I have recommended that we proceed with a right wrist ORIF and all indicated procedures. We reviewed the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery. I explained that we should schedule the operation for as soon as possible to ensure adequate healing and to limit malformation of the wrist. I advised that this procedure will require her to be admitted to the hospital for an overnight stay.

In the meantime, the patient will be placed in a thumb spica brace and receive instructions on its proper usage. I have prescribed the patient Ultram 50 mg every 6 hours to treat her pain. We also discussed that her postoperative course will include wearing a brace for 6 weeks. A few weeks after surgery, the patient will initiate formal physical therapy and will attend 3 times per week to strengthen her right wrist. The patient has a 2-week vacation planned in 1 month. I recommended that we consult with her physical therapist to determine if there are exercises she can perform on her own instead of postponing her vacation.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 4 weeks status post surgery to discuss her progress.

[doctor] okay
[patient] of anything the only thing i can think of is that i you know i am active and we've just been doing a lot of work in our basement so if i do n't know if i did something while doing that
[doctor] okay alright tell me have you ever had pain in that shoulder before
[patient] you know i i'm really active and so i i will get some aches and pains here and there but nothing that tylenol ca n't take care of
[doctor] okay good but now are you able to move your arm
[patient] you know i have trouble when i'm trying to reach for something or lift any objects and i do n't even try to reach it for anything over my head because then it'll really hurt
[doctor] okay alright and and now are you having the pain all the time or does it come and go
[patient] the pain is always there and then it gets worse like if i try to put any pressure on it it gets worse so if i'm laying at night if i try to even lay on that shoulder it's unbearable
[doctor] okay and then tell me what have you taken for your pain
[patient] i've been taking two extra strength tylenol every six to eight hours
[doctor] alright and and did that help
[patient] it does take the edge off but i still have some pain
[doctor] okay well i'm sorry to hear that you know you know renovating the basement it can be quite a task and it can take a toll on you
[patient] yeah i mean it's been fun but yeah i think it really did take a toll on me
[doctor] yeah what what are you doing with your basement are you are you doing like a a man cave or
[patient] yeah yeah that's exactly right

[doctor] okay sorry there is tenderness of the greater tuberosity of the humerus but there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acromioclavicular joints you have good hand grips alright and then now on your neurovascular exam of your left arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation is intact to light touch alright so what does that all mean well firstly lem me go ahead and take a look at your results of your shoulder x-ray here now i reviewed the results and there are no fractures so that's good so let's go ahead and talk about my assessment and plan here wayne so for your problem of left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to a rotator cuff tendinopathy so this means that you injured the tendons of the muscles that help make up your shoulder muscles so i will be ordering an mri for your left shoulder to be sure that there is nothing else going on with your shoulder okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] now i'm also going to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and during that time you may also continue to take tylenol now if your symptoms do n't improve we can consider a steroid injection for your shoulder which can provide some relief do you have any questions about your plan at all

Left shoulder pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Wayne Taylor is a pleasant 66-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left shoulder pain. The onset of his pain began 3 weeks ago. He denies any specific injury. The patient states he is active and has been renovating his basement. He reports a history of intermittent aches and pains in his left shoulder. He has difficulty reaching for or lifting any objects. He adds that he avoids reaching overhead secondary to the pain. The patient describes his pain as constant and worsening. He notes his pain is unbearable when lying on his left shoulder at night. He denies any numbness or tingling in the bilateral upper extremities. He has been taking 2 Extra Strength Tylenol every 6 to 8 hours, which provides some relief.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left shoulder pain. Neurological: Denies numbness or tingling in the bilateral upper extremities.

VITALS

All vital signs are within the normal limits.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds.

NEURO: Normal sensation. Sensation is intact to light touch in the left upper extremity.
MSK: Examination of the left shoulder: Limited active and passive ROM. Tenderness over the greater tuberosity of the humerus. No tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acromioclavicular joints. Good hand grip.

RESULTS

X-rays of the left shoulder were obtained and are reviewed today. These reveal there are no fractures.

ASSESSMENT

Left shoulder pain, most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his symptoms are most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy. I recommend obtaining an MRI of the left shoulder to further assess the rotator cuff. I will also refer him to formal physical therapy to strengthen his left shoulder for approximately 6 to 8 weeks. The patient was provided with educational materials regarding expectations related to his physical therapy. He may continue to take Tylenol as needed. If his symptoms do not improve with physical therapy, we will consider a steroid injection to the left shoulder. All questions were answered.

Left knee pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Andrea Barnes is a 34-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of left knee pain.

The patient has been experiencing intermittent episodes of pain and sudden instability with ambulation. Her pain is localized deep in her patella and occurs less than once daily. Due to the fleeting nature of these episodes, she has not taken medication and simply braces herself until it passes. She denies any trauma or injury, or ever hearing or feeling a pop in the knee. Her symptoms do not interfere with her daily activities and she does not use a cane.

Regarding her hypertension, it has been several days since she last checked her blood pressure at home, but it was approximately 120/70 mmHg at that time. Her current medications include amlodipine, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide, all of which she takes on a regular basis.

In terms of her diabetes, her fasting morning blood glucose levels have been approximately 130 based on home monitoring. This is slightly higher than usual, even though she has been compliant with metformin and Farxiga. She does try to avoid eating late at night.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports a personal history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient likes to travel and is planning a trip to Columbus, Georgia in the next month or so. She is part of the Lion's Club.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports that she is taking amlodipine, lisinopril 20 mg once daily, hydrochlorothiazide, Metformin, and Farxiga.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left knee pain and instability,

VITALS

Temperature: 98.2 degrees F
Heart rate: 72 bpm
Respirations: 16
Blood pressure: 122/70 mmHg

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right knee: No ecchymosis or edema. No effusion. No pain with palpation.
Examination of the left knee: Full range of motion. Negative varus and valgus stress test.

RESULTS

X-rays were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality.

ASSESSMENT

1. Left knee pain.
2. Hypertension.
3. Diabetes mellitus type 2.

PLAN

After reviewing the patients x-rays, I believe there is some arthritis in the knee. I'm going to prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once daily. We can consider physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around the area to prevent any further issues.

Her hypertension is well controlled with her current medication regimen. She can continue with lisinopril 20 mg once daily. I'm also going to order an echocardiogram for further evaluation of the murmur heard on exam.

She has been compliant with metformin as prescribed, but her blood glucose levels have been slightly elevated recently. I'm going to order a lipid panel, as well as a hemoglobin A1c to determine if any adjustments need to be made to her dose of metformin.","[doctor] okay hi andrea  i

[patient] the nursing staff and the office has been vy good to help with anything that i need as far as support. so just since we are just getting started so far on the journey, i do feel i have support and mentally still feel strong.
[doctor] okay, and how about with family or friends? have you been able to turn to anyone?
[patient] i do have good family membs that have been supportive and they have come to my treatment with me.
[doctor] okay, excellent. and so right now you are on a combination of two diffent chemothapies, the cisplestan as the eupside, and you had your last treatment just a few days ago, but you are saying right now you have been able to tolate the nausea and the fatigue.
[patient] yes, i have not had any nausea, but just slight fatigue. it does not seem to be ovwhelming.
[doctor] okay. so we are going to go ead, if it is okay with you, and start your physical exam reviewing your vitals. so vitals look good, especially your oxygen, especially with the chemothapy you have been getting and the cough. so your oxygen looks good, so i am happy with that. so now i am just examining your neck, especially with your sore throat, and i do not appreciate any cvical lymphadenopathy and also no supraclavicular adenopathy. listening to your heart, you have a nice regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs. that i appreciate. now, on your lung exam, when you are taking some deep breaths, i do notice some crackles in your lungs bilatally and what that means is the, is the is some faint sounds that i am hearing which could represent some fluid, the, so on. looking at your skin exam, on your chest, you do have some ythema on the antior side of the chest, on the left side, and this could be related to the radiation. so on your low extremities, i appreciate no edema and evything else looks good and thank you. i know you did a chest x-ray before coming in. so on your results for the chest x-ray, it does look you have some mild radiation pneonitis, which basically means some inflammation of the lungs. most ly due to the radiation. so what does this all mean? so for your assessment and plan. so for the first diagnosis, the first problem of the lung canc. so what we are going to do is we are going to continue with the current regimen of your chemothapy of the cisplacin and the etoside and we are going to continue with your current dose of radiation at forty five grade and when that's complete we will repeat some imaging and hopefully the tor will shrink down enough that we can remove it surgically. okay for problem nb two. so the radiation pneonitis. so that's what causing that cough, as some of the shortness of breath. i know you are not expiencing it much now. so what i am going to do for that is actually going to prescribe you a low dose of prednisone, and so that's an will help with the inflammation. i am going to give you forty milligrams daily for five days, and so hopefully that will help reduce the inflammation and so that you can continue with the radiation. okay, how does that sound so far?
[patient] that sounds great, thank you.
[doctor] okay. and then, lastly, for the painful swallowing that you are having. so the inflammation. you are having it not only in your lungs, but it also in your esophagus, as so what i am going to do is prescribe- you are taking the prednisone. i am also going to give you a lidocaine swish and swallow and you can do that four times a day, and so that will be able to help you so you can eat immediately, aft taking it, and it can also help so that you can continue to take food and fluids, prevent dehydration and any furth weight loss.
[patient] great.
[doctor] okay, any questions for me?
[patient] i do not believe so at this time.
[doctor] okay, alright, so i'll see you at your next visit.
[patient] great, thank you.
[doctor] you are welcome, and so now just."

[doctor] yeah i mean i do n't even really understand what that means but yeah that's what she told me
[patient] yeah that's a mouthful
[doctor] yeah
[patient] it it's the the one of the antibodies in your body and that that really makes that your body makes to fight infections it's a little bit low i'm happy to explain it a little bit more to you i just have a few more questions okay so let's start again here
[doctor] i'll do this
[patient] i i think i would break that
[doctor] yeah i just saw that

[doctor] okay
[patient] you can leave it the way it is for now i just i think break that up
[doctor] okay alright so yeah that sounds fine for me
[patient] yeah i do you know why she checked these levels in the first place that you've been having problems getting frequent infections
[doctor] yeah yeah i had a recent physical and she did this as part of her my physical i do tend to get infections but i do n't know i i'm so used to it so i do n't know if this is more than usual in the wintertime i get a lot of colds and they do seem to i always say that my colds kind of linger for a long time but i do n't know if it's more than usual
[patient] okay how about any abdominal infections
[doctor] diarrhea no
[patient] frequently
[doctor] no not that i can not that i say can think of
[patient] okay what about your family are are anyone in your family that you know have immune deficiencies
[doctor] no my family is actually pretty healthy
[patient] okay and how about do you have any other medical conditions
[doctor] yeah my pcp just started me on metformin i just got diagnosed with type two diabetes
[patient] okay okay yeah diabetes your family your family owns that donut shop right i mean down at the end of the street
[doctor] yes and that's probably part of the cause of my diabetes yes
[patient] yeah well i guess you're gon na have to watch that
[doctor] i know i know
[patient] but you know everything in moderation i mean just you know you just need to be careful you ca n't does n't have to go away
[doctor] right
[patient] but have you ever needed to receive a blood transfusion or blood products
[doctor] no i actually tried to give blood but they i did n't qualify because i had recently traveled internationally
[patient] okay where did you go
[doctor] i was in zambia
[patient] hmmm i heard that's beautiful
[doctor] it's so beautiful it's so beautiful i had a great time
[patient] okay well let me let me go ahead and do a physical examination here i reviewed your vitals you know that the the assistants collected when you first came in including your weight and everything looks good there there is no fever there there is nothing that i'm concerned about there now on your heart exam you have a nice regular rate and rhythm and i do n't appreciate any murmurs that's kind of those extra sounds that i would hear and that that all sounds good on lungs lung exam your lungs are clear there's no wheezes rales or rhonchi now on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymph lymphadenopathy swollen lymph glands and then let me just go ahead and i wan na press on your belly a little bit is that tender anywhere that i press it does n't seem like you making any facial
[doctor] no
[patient] no okay so your you know your abdominal exam is your belly is soft there is no tenderness as i i push around there now i did review the results of your recent lab work and it is consistent as as your pcp noted with an iga deficiency that's that immunoglobulin a that we talked about so let me tell you a little bit about the assessment and plan so for your first problem the that a iga deficiency is it very common immunodeficiency your your body makes many different types of antibodies in one of your z iga is just a little bit lower than normal now most of the time people live their entire life without even knowing they have that deficiency and function perfectly normal now some people may find that they get tend to get frequent respiratory tract or sinus or abdominal infections but this does n't necessarily seem to be the case for you now it can go along with other immunodeficiencies but i think there is a low likelihood hood in your case but we're gon na order some additional blood work that includes checking those other antibodies now do you have any questions on what i just told you
[doctor] yeah so is there anything i need to do or should be watching for or should i be worried
[patient] no i i really do n't think you need to be worried now we're gon na check these additional studies and that will give us some more guidance but really i think this is just a finding that's common to you and you know it it's many people have have have these type of you know immunodeficiency what i want you to watch for is those infections that do n't stop you have trouble getting it under control or you know any changes to your abdominal tract you know severe diarrhea
[doctor] anything like that then you know we may want to look at it a little bit further but for now i do n't think there is anything significant we want to do now go ahead and get your lab work and
[patient] bring you in for that now the only other thing that i would say is if you eat end up needing any blood products between now and when i see you next make sure you tell them that you have that iga deficiency
[doctor] why is that
[patient] well there is a risk that your body can strongly react to some blood products and they just need to know that so they're prepared so anytime you get blood just make sure you say that you have a history of a an an iga deficiency
[doctor] okay okay thank you
[patient] you're welcome
[doctor] okay","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Kyle Lee is a pleasant 46-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of low immunoglobulin A level. He was referred to our offices by his primary care physician after routine labs revealed abnormalities. The patient states he has been experiencing frequent infections. During the winter months, he experiences frequent colds that tend to linger, however this is not uncommon for him. The patient denies abdominal issues or diarrhea.

The patient was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. He is currently taking metformin.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient denies a history of blood transfusions.

SOCIAL HISTORY

He recently traveled internationally on a trip to Zambia. His family owns a local doughnut shop.

FAMILY HISTORY

Patient denies a family history of immune deficiencies.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Gastrointestinal: Denies abdominal issues or diarrhea.

VITALS

Temperature: Normal.
All other vitals were reviewed and are within normal limits.

PHYSICAL EXAM

NECK: No swelling noted. No lymphadenopathy.
CV: Normal heart rhythm with no murmurs.
RESPIRATORY: Lungs are clear. There's no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
Gastrointestinal: Abdomen is soft and without tenderness.

RESULTS

I did review the results of her recent lab work. It is consistent as her primary care physician noted with an IgA deficiency.

ASSESSMENT

IgA deficiency.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that the results of his recent lab work is consistent with an IgA deficiency. I have recommended that we obtain additional blood work to check his other antibodies. I encouraged the patient to be aware of lingering infections or abdominal changes including diarrhea. If he experiences these issues, he should report them to my office so we may investigate further, however I do not believe there is a need for that at this time. In the meantime, he should report this IgA deficiency in the event that he needs any blood transfusions. Questions were invited and answered today.","[doctor] alright

Right elbow pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Lawrence Butler is a pleasant 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right elbow pain.

Over the past week, the patient has developed 6/10 pain in the ""inside"" of his right elbow. The pain may radiate into his forearm on occasion, but does not extend up to his shoulder. He denies any history of trauma or injury, but he did start making pottery during the COVID-19 pandemic and suspects that his symptoms could be related to that. His symptoms affect his ability to lift objects or perform his typical activities of daily living. Ibuprofen provides minimal symptomatic relief.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that he began making pottery during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that he has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right elbow pain.

VITALS

Normal

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right elbow: Moderate tenderness at the medial epicondyle. No pain with supination of the forearm. Pain with pronation of the forearm. Pain with resistance against flexion of the wrist.

RESULTS

X-ray imaging of the right elbow was obtained and reviewed in office today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality.

ASSESSMENT

Right medial epicondylitis.

PLAN

The patient and I discussed his diagnosis in detail, and I explained that his symptoms are likely caused by overuse and potential damage of the tendons. We will provide him with sling to be worn during the day while he is awake. I want him to take ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours with food for a full week and ice the elbow for 20 minutes, 3 times daily. Finally, I advised the patient to rest his elbow and avoid doing any pottery for the next couple of weeks.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 1 week.","[doctor] hey lawrence how're you doing

Follow up.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient has been trying to limit his tobacco use for 2 years. He reports smoking once every week.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination: Lower extremities show trace edema.

RESULTS

An echocardiogram, obtained at an outside facility, was reviewed today. It demonstrates a preserved ejection fraction of 55%. Normal diastolic filling. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. CHF.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient’s recent epsiode resulting in the emergency room visit was likely caused by his dietary indiscretion and uncontrolled hypertension that we have been monitoring.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I reviewed the echocardiogram results with the patient and discussed the importance of following dietary restrictions. I encouraged the patient to take his medication on a consistent basis. I advised him to purchase a scale to weigh himself daily.
- Medical Treatment: He will continue Bumex 2 mg once daily. He was provided with a referral to a nutritionist in consultation for further assistance with his dietary requirements to lower his sodium intake.

2. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: This is currently uncontrolled.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained the importance of taking his medication on a daily basis. I encouraged the patient to purchase a blood pressure cuff and track his blood pressures.
- Medical Treatment: He will continue Cozaar 100 mg daily as well as the Norvasc 5 mg once daily. I will order a renal artery ultrasound for further evaluation.

3. Systolic ejection murmur.
- Medical Reasoning. Stable.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

aci,D2N086,"[doctor] hey nicholas nice to see you today your pcp looks like he sent you over for a nonhealing foot ulcer on your right foot can you tell me about how long you've had that
[patient] yeah i've had the boot for about six weeks i first noticed it when i put on a pair of shoes that were little bit too tight i felt some burning and some stinging and looked down and saw a blister i did n't think too much of it because it was on the pad of the bottom of my foot around my heel and i just had been walking on the front part of my foot i started to notice a foul smell and my wife mentioned something to me the other day and i noticed my dog was also smelling my socks a lot and so we looked and saw that the blister had become unroofed or the the top part of the skin of the blister became undone and then underneath it was just this really thick soft mushy skin that had a bad smell with some yellow drainage and so and barbara called the primary care doctor who then got me in to see you he started me on some antibiotics about six days ago and i never had any nausea or vomiting but my wife checked my temperature it was about ninety nine point seven and then at one point i had to put on an extra blanket in bed because i had some chills and when i started the antibiotics it started to feel pretty good but we've now noticed that it has turned black around the outside of the wound and i'm getting some cramping in my calf muscle as well and so there was a red streak also that was coming up the front part of my my ankle along the inside portion of my calf muscle and it's super super hot and so they wanted me to take a have have you look at it
[doctor] okay thank you for sharing that history with me and did you complete that course of antibiotics
[patient] i think he called in ten days' worth and i'm on day six or seven right now i know i've got about two or three days left
[doctor] okay and you mentioned that it had some stinging and it was a bit uncomfortable are you experiencing any pain right now
[patient] yeah it was it was stinging initially like i had just done something small but at this point it's it's really like throbbing it's almost like there is a fire poker in the bottom of my foot now and then the inside of my calf muscle is really hard and i've noticed that every time that i push that i feel it all the way up to my knee behind my kneecap and then noticed that i've been coughing a lot the last two days and then i've noticed that i've had like difficult time catching my breath when i'm walking around the house and so it's almost like two different things going on at this point
[doctor] okay so now i see here in your record that you have some that you're diabetic and have some diabetic neuropathy as well how's your blood sugars been running i'm i'm assuming kind of all over the place over the last i'm gon na say probably three or four weeks can you tell me about that
[patient] yeah my my a1c is six point seven it's pretty well controlled
[doctor] okay
[patient] i used to be on an insulin pump and i had an a1c that at one point was like thirteen but we worked with an endocrinologist to get it down to where it's at now i've been six point seven for probably two years now and i rarely have a blood sugar that goes over two hundred i check two or three times a day if i feel weird i'll check it again but i noticed my sugars have probably been trending in the three to four hundreds the last two weeks and then i had one spike at one point at like five or six hundred that got our attention and i think that's also what made my wife call the primary care doc
[doctor] okay now i know this was caused by a new pair of shoes you had mentioned before to your pcp and he relayed this to me that you really like to go on hikes you and your wife have been hiking have you gone to the new trails that that were just opened up here behind the park
[patient] yeah we actually hiked to charlie's bunion about a week before this i've had a new pair of diabetic shoes and inserts i get those every year i changed the inserts every three or four months i mean i've been in cruise control as far as that goes for some time i did get a new pair of shoes the prosthetist told me to check my feet every day for the first week or two which we did i did go hiking about the third or fourth day and i think that might be what caused it as i just went too far when we were hiking but yeah the trails are the trails are gorgeous they're open it's time to to be outside and i'm sorta stuck with this right now
[doctor] absolutely yeah my wife and i like to go back there and and hike those trails as well so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam for your vital signs i do recognize a slight fever however your vitals themselves look good now on your foot exam i do recognize the necrotic wound on your heel as you mentioned it is present it's approximately two by two centimeters i i do recognize the sloughing of the of the tissue as well as what looks like cellulitis around the area as well as erythemia so now unfortunately i do also smell the odor you are correct it is it does it is odds but i do not appreciate any bony exposure now on vascular exam i do have bilateral palpable pulses femorally and popliteal pulses are present however i do n't recognize a palpable pulse dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial however i did use the doppler and they are present via doppler now i'm gon na press on the actual affected area of the wound do you have any pain there
[patient] i do n't feel that right there
[doctor] okay i'm gon na review the results of your right foot x-ray that we did when you came in today the good news is i do n't see any evidence of osteomyelitis meaning that there is no infection of the bone so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for this nonhealing diabetic foot ulcer i'm going to order a test to check blood supply for this wound also i'm going to do a debridement today in the office we may have to look at we are going to do a culture and we may have to look at different antibiotic therapy i am concerned about the redness that's moving up your leg as well as this the the swelling and pain that you have in your calf so we're gon na monitor this very closely i wan na see you again in seven days and then as far as your diabetes is concerned i do want you to follow up with your endocrinologist and make sure that we do continue to keep your hemoglobin a1c below seven and we're gon na need to closely monitor your blood sugars since we're going to be doing some medication therapy with antibiotics and and potentially some other medications any other questions comments or concerns before i have the nurse come in we're gon na prep you for that procedure
[patient] no not really so you're gon na continue the antibiotics that i'm on and possibly extend or call in a new antibiotic depending on the culture
[doctor] correct
[patient] if i heard
[doctor] yep that's correct so what we're gon na do is you said you're six days in do a ten or twelve day course so we're gon na go ahead and continue your antibiotics therapy that your pcp put you on i do want to get the culture back and then we'll make the determination as far as additional or changing that antibiotic therapy
[patient] okay sounds good
[doctor] alright","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Non-healing ulcer on his right foot.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Nicholas Gutierrez is a pleasant 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a non-healing ulcer on his right foot. The patient was referred from his primary care physician. The onset of his pain began 6 weeks ago, after wearing a pair of shoes that were too tight.

Today, he describes a burning, stinging, and throbbing sensation. The patient reports a blister on the pad of the plantar aspect of his foot around his heel. He explains that he has been ambulating on the anterior aspect of his foot. He explains that the top part of the skin of the blister detached, which revealed a thick, soft, mushy skin associated with unpleasant smell and yellow drainage. The patient called his primary care physician, who referred him to our office. He was prescribed a 10-day course of antibiotics approximately 6 days ago. He experienced chills and a fever of 99.7 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient denies any nausea or vomiting. He states that when he started the antibiotics, his foot began to feel pretty good. However, he has now noticed that his foot has turned black around the outside of the wound, and he is experiencing cramping in his calf muscle as well. He also reports a burning red streak that was coming up the front part of his ankle along the inside portion of his calf muscle. While palpating his calf, he has noted stiffness in the muscle that is now up to the patella. The patient reports that he has been coughing a lot over the last 2 days. He has experienced shortness of breath with ambulation around the house. He reports that he purchases new diabetic shoes yearly and changes the inserts every 3 to 4 months.

The patient is diabetic and has diabetic neuropathy. He explains that his blood sugar has been trending in the 300 to 400's over the last 2 weeks. At one point, he had a blood sugar spike to either 500 or 600. He states that his last hemoglobin A1c was 6.7, which has been his average for approximately 2 years. The patient checks his blood sugar 2 to 3 times per day and rarely has a blood sugar that goes over 200. He explains that he used to be on an insulin pump and had an A1c that at one point was 13. He states that he worked with an endocrinologist to get it down to where it is now.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient reports a history of diabetic neuropathy.

SOCIAL HISTORY

VITALS

Temperature is slightly elevated.
Vitals are otherwise good.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Edema and pain in calf. Bilateral palpable femoral and papiteal pulses are present. I do not recognize a palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulse; however, they are present via Doppler.
MSK: Examination of the right foot: The necrotic wound on his heel is present. It is approximately 2 cm x 2 cm. I do recognize the sloughing of the tissue, as well as what looks like cellulitis around the area, and erythema. An odor is present from the wound. I do not appreciate any bony exposure now. No pain to palpation in the effected area.

RESULTS

3 views of the right foot were taken today. These reveal no evidence of osteomyelitis or infection.

ASSESSMENT

Right non-healing diabetic foot ulcer.
Diabetes.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that I do not see any evidence of osteomyelitis. I am concerned about the redness that is moving up his leg, as well as the swelling, and pain that he has in his calf. I have recommended that we obtain a venous ultrasound to check his blood supply for the wound. I have also recommended that we perform a debridement of the wound today. We may have to obtain a culture and look at different antibiotic therapy. I am recommending that he continue with antibiotics that his primary care physician prescribed.

In regard to his diabetes, I have advised him to follow up with his endocrinologist to ensure that we do continue to keep his hemoglobin A1c below 7. We will need to closely monitor his blood sugar since we are going to be doing some medication therapy with antibiotics and potentially some other medications depending on the culture results.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 7 days to check on his progress.","[doctor] hey nicholas nice to see you today your pcp looks  he sent you ov for a nonhealing foot ulc on your right foot can you tell me about how long you have had that

[doctor] okay
[patient] less
[doctor] i like it too alright are you taking the metformin twice a day
[patient] not everyday but most of the time
[doctor] okay alright and are you checking your blood sugars pretty regularly
[patient] i try to
[doctor] okay and do you do you know on average how they're running are they running below like one fifty or
[patient] yeah it's definitely running below that
[doctor] okay your blood sugars are running below
[patient] it's it's probably with with with the metformin it seems to be you know one twenty
[doctor] good
[patient] pretty regular
[doctor] good your blood sugars are running in the one twenties that's really good okay alright well i wan na just go ahead and do a quick physical exam okay so i'm looking here at your vital signs and your vital signs look really good i do think you're doing a good job with taking your lisinopril your blood pressure's about one twenty two over seventy right now which is right where we want it your heart rate is nice and slow at sixty seven again which is right where we want it and i do n't appreciate any fever today you you have a normal temperature at ninety eight . four which is really good so i'm just gon na be going ahead and calling out some physical exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what that means when i'm done okay so on your heart exam your heart is in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur rub or gallop on your lung exam your lungs are nice and clear to auscultation bilaterally on your right knee exam i do appreciate some erythema and edema as well as an area of fluctuance over your right patella now does it hurt when i press
[patient] it's a little bit sore
[doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right anterior knee and i'm just gon na bend your knee up and down does that hurt at all
[patient] no no it's just more of the typical grinding that i would feel
[doctor] okay there is full range of motion of the right knee and on skin examination there is evidence of a bull's-eye rash over the right knee okay so what does that mean richard so that means that you know you do have some area of some inflammation over the over the right knee where you where you have that tick bite and you do have what we call that bull's eye rash which is what we get concerned about with with lyme disease so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you okay so for this first problem of your of your tick bite my concern is that you might have lyme disease based on the presentation of your right knee so i'm gon na go ahead and start you on doxycycline one hundred milligrams twice a day
[patient] we're gon na continue that for about three weeks i'm also gon na go ahead and send a lyme titer as well as a western blot to see if you do in fact have lyme lyme disease and we'll have to go ahead and just see how you do with this we you know i'd like to avoid intravenous antibiotics which i think we can avoid but i wanted to see how you do so
[doctor] do you have any questions about that
[patient] yeah i did n't know what those last two things or just
[doctor] yeah so so we are gon na start you on some antibiotics to help help you with this
[patient] you know possible lyme disease and i'm gon na just order some blood tests just to see exactly what's going on and then you know sometimes people need intravenous antibiotics because lyme disease can cause problems on other organs like your heart that type of thing
[doctor] if not treated appropriately and sometimes we need to give antibiotics through the iv which i'd like to avoid i think that we got this early enough that we can just treat you with some oral antibiotics okay for your second problem of your hypertension you know i think you're doing a really good job let's go ahead and continue you on the lisinopril twenty milligrams once a day and i wan na just go ahead and order a lipid panel just to make sure that everything is okay with your cholesterol how does that sound
[patient] that's fine
[doctor] great and then for your third problem of your diabetes i wan na just go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c and continue you on the metformin one thousand milligrams twice a day it sounds like you're doing a good job since your blood sugars are running in the one twenties i do n't think we need to make any adjustments but we'll see what the hemoglobin a1c shows that gives us a an idea of what your blood sugars are doing on a long-term basis how does that sound
[patient] okay at what point time do you start kinda checking kidney function i've been told that metformin can possibly cause some kidney issues
[doctor] so it can you know your kidney function we've you know i think you've been really lucky it's been normal i checked it about two months ago and it looks pretty good it looks pretty normal but since we're doing blood work on you i can go ahead and order a a basic metabolic panel just to make sure that your kidney function is stable
[patient] okay that'd be good
[doctor] okay anything else
[patient] not that i can think of at this time as soon as i leave
[doctor] well you know where to find me okay
[patient] alright
[doctor] take care bye","CHIEF COMPLAINT

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Tick bite.
- Medical Reasoning: My concern is that he might have Lyme disease based on the presentation of his right knee.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed blood testing to determine if he does in fact have Lyme disease. I explained that Lyme disease can cause problems with other organs if not treated appropriately. We discussed that sometimes antibiotics need to be administered intravenously if oral antibiotics are not given early enough. We will see how he does with a course of oral antibiotics as I would like to avoid intravenous antibiotics.
- Medical Treatment: Prescription for doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 3 weeks provided. Lyme titer and Western blot will be obtained to determine if he has Lyme disease.

2. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: This is well-controlled at this time.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed that he is doing really well monitoring his blood pressure at home.
- Medical Treatment: Continue lisinopril 20 mg once a day. Lipid panel ordered to assess his cholesterol levels.

3. Diabetes type 2.
- Medical Reasoning: He is doing a good job managing his diabetes since his blood sugars are running in the 120s. I do not think we need to make any adjustments, but we will see what the hemoglobin A1c shows as that gives us an idea of what his blood sugars are doing on a long-term basis.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that metformin can affect kidney function; however, his kidney function was last checked 2 months ago, and it has remained within normal limits.
- Medical Treatment: Continue metformin 1000 mg twice a day. Hemoglobin A1c ordered. Basic metabolic panel ordered to assess kidney function. 

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","[doctor] hi richard how are you the medical assistant told me that you have a tick bite is that what happened
