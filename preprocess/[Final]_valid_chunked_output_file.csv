Martha Collins is a 50-year-old female with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure, depression, and hypertension who presents for her annual exam.

Congestive heart failure.
• Medical Reasoning: She has been compliant with her medication and dietary modifications. Her previous year's echocardiogram demonstrated a reduced ejection fraction of 45%, as well as some mitral regurgitation. Her cholesterol levels were slightly elevated on her lipid panel from last year.
• Additional Testing: We will order a repeat echocardiogram. We will also repeat a lipid panel this year.
• Medical Treatment: She will continue with her current medications. We will increase her lisinopril to 40 mg daily and initiate Lasix 20 mg daily.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged her to continue with dietary modifications.

Depression.
• Medical Reasoning: She is doing well with weekly therapy.

Hypertension.
• Medical Reasoning: She has been compliant with dietary modifications but has been inconsistent with the use of her medication. She attributes elevations in her blood pressure to increased stress.
• Medical Treatment: We will increase her lisinopril to 40 mg daily as noted above.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to take her lisinopril as directed. I advised her to monitor her blood pressures at home for the next week and report them to me.

Healthcare maintenance.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient is due for her routine mammogram.
• Additional Testing: We will order a mammogram and have this scheduled for her.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

Joint pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Andrew Perez is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for a kidney transplant, hypothyroidism, and arthritis. He presents today with complaints of joint pain.

The patient reports that over the weekend, he was moving boxes up and down the basement stairs. By the end of the day, his knees were very painful. The pain is equal in the bilateral knees. He states that he has had some knee problems in the past, but he believes that it was due to the repetition and the weight of the boxes. He states that the pain does not prevent him from doing his activities of daily living. By the end of the day on Saturday, his knee soreness interrupted his sleep. The patient has taken Tylenol and iced his knees for a short period of time, but nothing really seemed to help.

The patient states that he had a kidney transplant a few years ago for some polycystic kidneys. He notes that he saw Dr. Gutierrez a couple of weeks ago, and everything was normal at that time. The patient continues to utilize his immunosuppressant medications.

Regarding his hypothyroidism, the patient states that he is doing well. He has continued to utilize Synthroid regularly.

In regards to his arthritis, the patient states that occasionally he has pain in his elbow, but nothing out of the ordinary.

He denies any other symptoms such as fever, chills, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and weight loss.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional: Denies fevers, chills, or weight loss.
• Musculoskeletal: Denies muscle pain. Endorses joint pain in the bilateral knees.
• Neurological: Denies headaches.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Cardiovascular: 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, stable.
• Musculoskeletal: There is edema and erythema of the right knee with pain to palpation. Range of motion is decreased. Left knee exam is normal.

RESULTS

X-ray of the right knee is unremarkable. Good bony alignment. No acute fractures.

Labs: Within normal limits. White blood cell count is within normal limits. Kidney function is normal.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Andrew Perez is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for a kidney transplant, hypothyroidism, and arthritis. He presents today with complaints of joint pain.

Arthritis.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient reports increased joint pain in his bilateral knees over the past weekend. Given that his right knee x-ray was unremarkable, I believe this is an acute exacerbation of his arthritis.
• Additional Testing: We will order an autoimmune panel for further evaluation.
• Medical Treatment: Initiate Ultram 50 mg every 6 hours as needed.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to rest his knees. If his symptoms persist, we can consider further imaging and possibly a referral to physical therapy.

Hypothyroidism.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient is doing well on Synthroid and is asymptomatic at this time.
• Additional Testing: We will order a thyroid panel.
• Medical Treatment: Continue Synthroid.

Status post renal transplant.
• Medical Reasoning: He is doing well and has been compliant with his immunosuppressive medications. On recent labs, his white blood cell count was within a normal limits and his kidney function is stable.
• Medical Treatment: Continue current regimen.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.",1,1,"[doctor] hi andrew, how are you?

He states that he has had some knee problems in the past, but he believes that it was due to the repetition and the weight of the boxes. He states that the pain does not prevent him from doing his activities of daily living. By the end of the day on Saturday, his knee soreness interrupted his sleep. The patient has taken Tylenol and iced his knees for a short period of time, but nothing really seemed to help.

The patient states that he had a kidney transplant a few years ago for some polycystic kidneys. He notes that he saw Dr. Gutierrez a couple of weeks ago, and everything was normal at that time. The patient continues to utilize his immunosuppressant medications.

Regarding his hypothyroidism, the patient states that he is doing well. He has continued to utilize Synthroid regularly.

In regards to his arthritis, the patient states that occasionally he has pain in his elbow, but nothing out of the ordinary.

He denies any other symptoms such as fever, chills, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and weight loss.

Joint pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Andrew Perez is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for a kidney transplant, hypothyroidism, and arthritis. He presents today with complaints of joint pain.

The patient reports that over the weekend, he was moving boxes up and down the basement stairs. By the end of the day, his knees were very painful. The pain is equal in the bilateral knees. He states that he has had some knee problems in the past, but he believes that it was due to the repetition and the weight of the boxes. He states that the pain does not prevent him from doing his activities of daily living. By the end of the day on Saturday, his knee soreness interrupted his sleep. The patient has taken Tylenol and iced his knees for a short period of time, but nothing really seemed to help.

The patient states that he had a kidney transplant a few years ago for some polycystic kidneys. He notes that he saw Dr. Gutierrez a couple of weeks ago, and everything was normal at that time. The patient continues to utilize his immunosuppressant medications.

Regarding his hypothyroidism, the patient states that he is doing well. He has continued to utilize Synthroid regularly.

In regards to his arthritis, the patient states that occasionally he has pain in his elbow, but nothing out of the ordinary.

He denies any other symptoms such as fever, chills, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and weight loss.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Andrew Perez is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for a kidney transplant, hypothyroidism, and arthritis. He presents today with complaints of joint pain.

Arthritis.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient reports increased joint pain in his bilateral knees over the past weekend. Given that his right knee x-ray was unremarkable, I believe this is an acute exacerbation of his arthritis.
• Additional Testing: We will order an autoimmune panel for further evaluation.
• Medical Treatment: Initiate Ultram 50 mg every 6 hours as needed.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to rest his knees. If his symptoms persist, we can consider further imaging and possibly a referral to physical therapy.

Hypothyroidism.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient is doing well on Synthroid and is asymptomatic at this time.
• Additional Testing: We will order a thyroid panel.
• Medical Treatment: Continue Synthroid.

Status post renal transplant.
• Medical Reasoning: He is doing well and has been compliant with his immunosuppressive medications. On recent labs, his white blood cell count was within a normal limits and his kidney function is stable.
• Medical Treatment: Continue current regimen.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. John Perry is a 61-year-old male with a past medical history significant for kidney stones, migraines, and gastroesophageal reflux, who presents with some back pain.

The patient reports that he is feeling a lot of the same pain that he had when he had kidney stones about 2 years ago, so he is a little concerned.

He endorses nausea and vomiting if he exerts himself or climbs the stairs to his apartment or runs to catch the bus. He also endorses dizziness and lightheadedness with pain in his abdomen.

Regarding his migraines, he has been diligent about taking the Imitrex. He denies issues with the migraines.

Regarding his gastroesophageal reflux, he reports that he has been doing well with his diet, but notes lately with his pain, he has been eating more fast food and takeout since these options come with delivery. He is staying hydrated. He is taking Protonix 40 mg daily as directed.

James Allen is a 57-year-old male with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure and type 2 diabetes, who presents today with back pain.

The patient states he was golfing and hurt his back. This happened approximately 4 days ago when he felt a pop in his back. The patient notes that he immediately hit the ground trying to loosen up his back. He reports taking some Tylenol, ibuprofen, and using ice and heat which did not relieve the pain. By Monday morning it loosened up a little bit, but it is still pretty sore. He had some right lower extremity weakness and some drop foot that he felt that for a while, and it got a little better this morning but not much. He had surgery about 10 years ago in his lower back.

Regarding his congestive heart failure, he has been watching his diet and trying to exercise regularly. He is avoiding the salty foods and has been compliant with medications. He has gained a little weight over the summer but nothing more than 5 pounds. He has no problems lying flat to go to bed.

Regarding his diabetes, he is watching his blood sugars at home, not always consistently. He is still on his metformin.

Follow-up of chronic problems.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Anna Mitchell is a 44-year-old female with a past medical history significant for arthritis, gout, and reflux, who presents today for follow-up of her chronic problems. It has been about 6 months since I last saw the patient.

The patient reports her arthritis is starting to get better. She has been trying to move her body with pilates and lifting weights. This has helped build up some muscles and her joint pain has reduced. The patient has also continued to attend physical therapy, which she feels has been beneficial.

Ms. Mitchell had an episode of gout of her right first big toe about 2 months ago. She states she is doing well on the allopurinol 100 mg once daily and has had no further flare ups.

Regarding her acid reflux, she was placed on omeprazole 40 mg once a day to help with some of the symptoms she was having. She started to make some dietary modifications, but she still needs to make more progress. She reports episodes of vomiting in the morning. The patient also has abdominal pain and bloating. Her last bowel movement was 2 days ago, and it was normal. She denies blood in her stool.

The patient denies unexplained weight gain or loss, fevers, chills.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional: Denies fevers, chills, or weight loss.
• Gastrointestinal: Denies hematochezia, melena. Endorses vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloating.
• Musculoskeletal: Endorses joint pain.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
• Cardiovascular: No murmurs, gallops, or rubs. No extra heart sounds.
• Gastrointestinal: Pain to palpation of the right upper quadrant. No rebound or guarding. No peritoneal signs.
• Musculoskeletal: Right knee shows a little effusion. Slight pain to palpation. Some decreased range of motion.

RESULTS

Autoimmune panel is within normal limits.

X-ray of the right knee demonstrates residual arthritis. No fractures noted.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Anna Mitchell is a 44-year-old female with a past medical history significant for arthritis, gout, and reflux, who presents today for follow-up of her chronic problems.

Acid reflux with nausea and vomiting.
• Medical Reasoning: She reports episodes of vomiting in the morning, as well as abdominal pain and bloating. She has been compliant with omeprazole and has made a few dietary modifications.
• Additional Testing: We will order an ultrasound of her right upper quadrant, as well as additional labs, to rule out biliary etiology.
• Medical Treatment: Continue omeprazole 40 mg once daily.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged her to continue with dietary modifications.

Gout.
• Medical Reasoning: Her flares are well controlled on allopurinol.
• Medical Treatment: Continue allopurinol 100 mg once daily. This was refilled today.

Arthritis.
• Medical Reasoning: She is doing well and has remained active since her last visit. Physical therapy has also been beneficial for her. Her right knee x-ray demonstrated residual arthritis but was otherwise normal.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised her to continue pilates and using the knee. She will contact me if she has any issues and we can consider further imaging or intervention at that time.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.",5,1,"[doctor] hi anna, how are you?

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Anna Mitchell is a 44-year-old female with a past medical history significant for arthritis, gout, and reflux, who presents today for follow-up of her chronic problems. It has been about 6 months since I last saw the patient.

The patient reports her arthritis is starting to get better. She has been trying to move her body with pilates and lifting weights. This has helped build up some muscles and her joint pain has reduced. The patient has also continued to attend physical therapy, which she feels has been beneficial.

Ms. Mitchell had an episode of gout of her right first big toe about 2 months ago. She states she is doing well on the allopurinol 100 mg once daily and has had no further flare ups.

Regarding her acid reflux, she was placed on omeprazole 40 mg once a day to help with some of the symptoms she was having. She started to make some dietary modifications, but she still needs to make more progress. She reports episodes of vomiting in the morning. The patient also has abdominal pain and bloating. Her last bowel movement was 2 days ago, and it was normal. She denies blood in her stool.

Roger Nelson is a 62-year-old male who presents for emergency room follow-up for chest pain. The patient was doing yard work over the weekend when he began to feel short of breath and a full chest pain for approximately hour. He denies a history of chest pain. The patient notes that after he finished he felt fine. He has not had any other symptoms since that time. He denies a family history of heart disease.

The patient underwent right knee surgery a couple of months ago and has been feeling well since then. He has been in rehab and recovery. He denies chest pain while doing exercises in physical therapy for his knee.

His blood pressure was noted to be 180/95 mmHg when he visited the emergency room. He notes that his blood pressure has not been as high as usual.

The patient is a 62-year-old male who presents for emergency room follow-up. He presented to the emergency room for chest pain and elevated blood pressure of 180/95. His EKG from the emergency room was normal, but ejection fraction on echocardiogram was abnormal. His blood pressure today was still elevated.

Chest pain and hypertension.
• Medical Reasoning: Given his recent episode of blood pressure elevation and chest pain, I suspect an element of coronary artery disease as well as pumping dysfunction.
• Medical Treatment: We will change his blood pressure regimen to carvedilol 25 mg twice a day. He should also continue lisinopril 10 mg a day and I want to see how his blood pressure does on that regimen. I also recommended cardiac catheterization on him to make sure that he does not have any blockages in his heart.

His EKG from the emergency room was normal, but ejection fraction on echocardiogram was abnormal. His blood pressure today was still elevated.

Chest pain and hypertension.
• Medical Reasoning: Given his recent episode of blood pressure elevation and chest pain, I suspect an element of coronary artery disease as well as pumping dysfunction.
• Medical Treatment: We will change his blood pressure regimen to carvedilol 25 mg twice a day. He should also continue lisinopril 10 mg a day and I want to see how his blood pressure does on that regimen. I also recommended cardiac catheterization on him to make sure that he does not have any blockages in his heart.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.
",10,3,"[doctor] okay, all right. all right, and i know that you had the knee surgy-.

Mr. Fisher is a 59-year-old male who presents for routine follow up of his chronic problems.

Mr. Fisher reports that he has been managing his depression. He is on Prozac 20 mg daily and was taking it regularly, but weaned himself off of it and felt a little better. He is currently taking less of a dose and does not feel the side effects as much, but he is willing to try something different. His asthma has been acting up because of the bad pollen season and has been using his inhaler when it seems to go over 85 degrees. He does not use it if it is cold outside. He is keeping his diabetes under control. The patient 's diet has been good for the most part, but has been traveling all over for his children's sports tournaments and did not stick to his diet and notes over the weekend eating pizza.

Echocardiogram demonstrates stable diminished ejection fraction.
Skin cancer pathology demonstrates clear margins.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

The patient is a 58-year-old male who presents for follow-up after emergency room visit.

ED follow-up and congestive heart failure.
• Medical Reasoning: I believe his symptoms which led to his ED visit were due to an exacerbation of his heart failure. He admits to some dietary indiscretion, which likely resulted in fluid retention.
• Medical Treatment: I will prescribe Lasix 80 mg once a day. I will also place him on carvedilol 25 mg twice a day.

Status post basal cell carcinoma removal.
• Medical Reasoning: He seems to be doing well and the removal site is well-healed. No change in treatment is necessary at this time.

Status post cataract surgery.
• Medical Reasoning: He seems to be doing well. We will continue to observe, but no treatment changes are needed today.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Cardiovascular: Endorses dyspnea on exertion. Endorses palpitations.
• Respiratory: Endorses shortness of breath.
• Musculoskeletal: Endorses back pain.
• Integumentary:
• Psychiatric: Endorses depression.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Respiratory: Mild wheezes bilaterally.

RESULTS

Pulmonary function test demonstrates mild asthma and the appearance of COPD.

X-ray of the chest demonstrates flattening of the diaphragm which is consistent with COPD.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

COPD.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient presents today with shortness of breath with exertion. Her pulmonary function tests suggest asthma or COPD and her most recent chest x-ray and physical examination today are also consistent with COPD.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I counseled the patient on the importance of smoking cessation.
• Medical Treatment: We will start the patient on Combivent, 2 puffs twice a day. I will also prescribe an albuterol inhaler, 2 puffs as needed, and a prednisone taper pack.

Depression.
• Medical Reasoning: It sounds like her depression is stable, so we will not change anything at this time.
• Patient Education and Counseling: She will keep taking the Effexor. I encouraged her to practice yoga for depression relief as well as her back pain.

Chronic back pain.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient says she is doing well on Neurontin with only occasional exacerbation of the pain.
• Medical Treatment: She can continue Neurontin as is. I also encouraged her to practice yoga for her back pain.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.",14,6,"[patient] it is, it is definitely, i feel, bett.

Hypothyroidism.
Abnormal liver enzymes.
Abnormal weight gain.
Acne vulgaris.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Christine Hernandez is a 39-year-old female who presents today for evaluation and management of abnormal liver enzymes and hypothyroidism.

When the patient was last seen, her thyroid medicine was changed to Unithroid, but due to the cost of $75, she has not yet started the new medicine and continues taking her previous thyroid medicine. She denies utilizing the coupon that was previously recommended for the Unithroid. Similarly, the patient was prescribed Epiduo for her acne vulgaris, which she did not fill due to the cost of $100. She tried filling both prescriptions at Walmart.

Mrs. Hernandez still presents with abnormal weight gain. She questioned if her oral contraceptive Microgestin, which was discontinued, could have been the cause. Additional symptoms included acne, hirsutism. She is attempting to modify her intake and plans to resume her gym membership in July as she will be on vacation. She inquired about the impact on weight loss of chromium, CLA, and amino acids.

The patient confirmed that she is taking her high dose Vitamin D as prescribed. She does suffer from constipation and she treats with MiraLAX.

She denies previous treatment for her acne vulgaris. She denies ever using clindamycin topical antibiotic. She reports having sensitive skin, developing rashes with various skin products.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Hypothyroidism.
Acne Vulgaris.
Vitamin D deficiency.
Abnormal weight gain.
Hirsutism.
Constipation.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Benzoyl Peroxide.
Clindamycin Gel applied topically.
Vitamin D 2000 IU daily.
Unithroid.
MiraLAX.

ALLERGIES

No known allergies.

RESULTS

Dexamethasone Suppression Test: Normal.

Salivary Cortisol Tests: 2 out of 3 were normal. Not consistent with Cushing’s Syndrome.

Hepatic Function Panel: ALT 128.
Lipid Panel: Total cholesterol 222 mg/dL, HDL 44 mg/dL, LDL 153 mg/dL, non-HDL 178 mg/dL.

FAI: Normal.

ASSESSMENT

• Hypothyroidism.
• Abnormal liver enzymes.
• Abnormal weight gain.
• Acne vulgaris
• Vitamin D deficiency.
• Hirsutism

PLAN

Hypothyroidism
The patient will again attempt to initiate Unithroid. I have printed out the prescription and a discount card, which should result in a reduced price. She will contact my office if she encounters additional issues.

Abnormal liver enzymes
We have seen improvement since the discontinuation of Microgestin. I recommended the spermicide Phexxi for alternative birth control. The patient will also continue working on weight loss, which should additionally improve her liver enzymes.

Abnormal weight gain
Cushing’s Syndrome has been ruled out. I reviewed the weight loss study with the patient, she will call within a month if she is interested in participating. I advised her to follow a low carbohydrate, low cholesterol, abstain from alcohol, and reduce fatty foods diet.

Acne vulgaris
Epiduo was not covered and too expensive. The patient will try benzoyl peroxide and Clindamycin separately to see if the price improves.

Vitamin D deficiency
The patient will complete the high dose vitamin D and then should start vitamin D 2000 IU per day to maintain her levels.

Hirsutism
Her androgen levels were normal.

INSTRUCTIONS

She will repeat all labs prior to her next visit.

Christine Hernandez is a 39-year-old female who presents today for evaluation and management of abnormal liver enzymes and hypothyroidism.

When the patient was last seen, her thyroid medicine was changed to Unithroid, but due to the cost of $75, she has not yet started the new medicine and continues taking her previous thyroid medicine. She denies utilizing the coupon that was previously recommended for the Unithroid. Similarly, the patient was prescribed Epiduo for her acne vulgaris, which she did not fill due to the cost of $100. She tried filling both prescriptions at Walmart.

Mrs. Hernandez still presents with abnormal weight gain. She questioned if her oral contraceptive Microgestin, which was discontinued, could have been the cause. Additional symptoms included acne, hirsutism. She is attempting to modify her intake and plans to resume her gym membership in July as she will be on vacation. She inquired about the impact on weight loss of chromium, CLA, and amino acids.

The patient confirmed that she is taking her high dose Vitamin D as prescribed. She does suffer from constipation and she treats with MiraLAX.

She denies previous treatment for her acne vulgaris. She denies ever using clindamycin topical antibiotic. She reports having sensitive skin, developing rashes with various skin products.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Christine Hernandez is a 39-year-old female who presents today for evaluation and management of abnormal liver enzymes and hypothyroidism.

When the patient was last seen, her thyroid medicine was changed to Unithroid, but due to the cost of $75, she has not yet started the new medicine and continues taking her previous thyroid medicine. She denies utilizing the coupon that was previously recommended for the Unithroid. Similarly, the patient was prescribed Epiduo for her acne vulgaris, which she did not fill due to the cost of $100. She tried filling both prescriptions at Walmart.

Mrs. Hernandez still presents with abnormal weight gain. She questioned if her oral contraceptive Microgestin, which was discontinued, could have been the cause. Additional symptoms included acne, hirsutism. She is attempting to modify her intake and plans to resume her gym membership in July as she will be on vacation. She inquired about the impact on weight loss of chromium, CLA, and amino acids.

The patient confirmed that she is taking her high dose Vitamin D as prescribed. She does suffer from constipation and she treats with MiraLAX.

She denies previous treatment for her acne vulgaris. She denies ever using clindamycin topical antibiotic. She reports having sensitive skin, developing rashes with various skin products.

She denies utilizing the coupon that was previously recommended for the Unithroid. Similarly, the patient was prescribed Epiduo for her acne vulgaris, which she did not fill due to the cost of $100. She tried filling both prescriptions at Walmart.

Mrs. Hernandez still presents with abnormal weight gain. She questioned if her oral contraceptive Microgestin, which was discontinued, could have been the cause. Additional symptoms included acne, hirsutism. She is attempting to modify her intake and plans to resume her gym membership in July as she will be on vacation. She inquired about the impact on weight loss of chromium, CLA, and amino acids.

The patient confirmed that she is taking her high dose Vitamin D as prescribed. She does suffer from constipation and she treats with MiraLAX.

She denies previous treatment for her acne vulgaris. She denies ever using clindamycin topical antibiotic. She reports having sensitive skin, developing rashes with various skin products.

Hypothyroidism.
Abnormal liver enzymes.
Abnormal weight gain.
Acne vulgaris.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Christine Hernandez is a 39-year-old female who presents today for evaluation and management of abnormal liver enzymes and hypothyroidism.

When the patient was last seen, her thyroid medicine was changed to Unithroid, but due to the cost of $75, she has not yet started the new medicine and continues taking her previous thyroid medicine. She denies utilizing the coupon that was previously recommended for the Unithroid. Similarly, the patient was prescribed Epiduo for her acne vulgaris, which she did not fill due to the cost of $100. She tried filling both prescriptions at Walmart.

Mrs. Hernandez still presents with abnormal weight gain. She questioned if her oral contraceptive Microgestin, which was discontinued, could have been the cause. Additional symptoms included acne, hirsutism. She is attempting to modify her intake and plans to resume her gym membership in July as she will be on vacation. She inquired about the impact on weight loss of chromium, CLA, and amino acids.

The patient confirmed that she is taking her high dose Vitamin D as prescribed. She does suffer from constipation and she treats with MiraLAX.

She denies previous treatment for her acne vulgaris. She denies ever using clindamycin topical antibiotic. She reports having sensitive skin, developing rashes with various skin products.

Right index finger hyperextension injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Philip Gutierrez is a pleasant 50-year-old right-hand-dominant male here today for a 2nd opinion regarding evaluation of the right index finger hyperextension injury sustained during a motor vehicle accident in 03/2021.

In summary, the patient was the passenger in a vehicle that was rear-ended. He reports they were hit multiple times as he felt 2 bumps which caused his to sling forward hyperextending his right index finger. He was offered an injection of the A1 pulley region, but he did not want any steroid due to a reaction to dexamethasone that causes his heart to race. The patient was scheduled to see Dr. Alice Davis, but he has not seen his yet. The patient has been seen at Point May Orthopedics, by the physical therapy staff and a physician assistant at that practice. He underwent an MRI of the right index finger because they were concerned about a capsular strain plus or minus a rupture of the ""FDS tendon.""

The patient states that he is unable to make a fist secondary to pain and swelling in the right index finger. He describes a pulling, tearing sensation in the right index finger. The pain is exacerbated by driving. He notes that he has been wearing a right index finger splint.

The patient denies any history of diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis. He reports only taking medication for hypertension and denies taking any other chronic medications of significance. He also notes methylprednisolone causes his to itch.

Ms. Gutierrez is employed as an x-ray technician.

PAST HISTORY

SOCIAL HISTORY

ALLERGIES

Methylprednisolone causes itching.
Dexamethasone causes palpitations.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Musculoskeletal: Right index finger pain.
• Endocrine: Denies diabetes.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Constitutional
Very pleasant, healthy appearing, cooperative male in no distress.

Neurological
Grossly intact. Slightly diminished sensation to light touch over the right PIP joint of the index finger compared to the middle finger.

Cardiovascular
Regular rate and rhythm.

Musculoskeletal
Exam of the right hand, there is no swelling or ecchymosis in the palm on the volar surface of his index finger. Normal creases are noted. Index finger rests in a 10 degree PIP joint flexed position with discomfort upon correction. Bilateral extremities 2+ radial pulses.

RESULTS

X-rays today, 4 views of the right hand, show no bony abnormalities. Joint congruency throughout all lesser digits on the right hand. No soft tissue shadows of concern. No arthritis.

MRI of the right index finger performed on 04/24/2021. Independent review of the images shows focal soft tissue swelling over the right index MCP joint, partial-thickness tear of the right FDS, and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the FDP and FDS tendons. Radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index MCP joint were intact as was the MCP joint capsule. The extensor tendons were also deemed intact.

ASSESSMENT

• Stenosing tenosynovitis of right index finger.

Ms. Philip Gutierrez is a pleasant 50-year-old right-hand-dominant male here today for a 2nd opinion of his right index finger hyperextension injury sustained during a motor vehicle accident in March of this year. The findings of his examination are consistent with rather severe post-traumatic stenosing tenosynovitis.

PLAN

The patient and I had a lengthy discussion regarding his history, symptoms, and radiographic findings. We discussed the pathophysiology and natural history of stenosing tenosynovitis and the anatomy of the flexor tendons and pulley system in the hand. I explained to the patient that the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon was clearly intact and that He is suffering from post-traumatic inflammation around the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon blocking excursion of the flexor tendons to the A1 pulley.

Treatment options were discussed including conservative management with corticosteroid injections and their statistical effectiveness. Surgical correction was also briefly discussed, although I recommend exhausting non-operative measures with a minimum of 2 injections before proceeding with surgery. I recommended a right index trigger finger cortisone injection today, and the patient elected to proceed. I also recommend that the patient report to occupational therapy once a week for the next 6 weeks to work on full active and passive right index finger range of motion with no restrictions.

The patient verbalizes understanding with the treatment plan and agrees. All questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction today.

PROCEDURE

Right index trigger finger injection.
The patient understands the risks and benefits and elected to proceed, signed consent obtained. An attempt was made to inject 1.0 cc of Celestone with 0.5 cc of lidocaine. However, the patient had a dramatic and violent painful reaction to the introduction of the needle with contortions of the hand and with dangerously withdrawing the hand with concerns for secondary needle stick. Therefore, the needle was withdrawn. The patient was counseled as to the importance of attempting to get some therapeutic steroid in the flexor tendon sheath. We attempted a 2nd time for a similar injection using the same technique with 1.0 cc of Celestone and 0.5 cc of lidocaine. There was a small palmar vein that bled a scant amount, which was cleaned up off the back of the patient's hand. A Band-Aid was applied. He was reassured on multiple occasions that no harm was done to his finger. I recommended icing it this evening and taking ibuprofen.

INSTRUCTIONS

Occupational therapy as prescribed.

Treatment options were discussed including conservative management with corticosteroid injections and their statistical effectiveness. Surgical correction was also briefly discussed, although I recommend exhausting non-operative measures with a minimum of 2 injections before proceeding with surgery. I recommended a right index trigger finger cortisone injection today, and the patient elected to proceed. I also recommend that the patient report to occupational therapy once a week for the next 6 weeks to work on full active and passive right index finger range of motion with no restrictions.

The patient verbalizes understanding with the treatment plan and agrees. All questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction today.

PROCEDURE

Right index trigger finger injection.
The patient understands the risks and benefits and elected to proceed, signed consent obtained. An attempt was made to inject 1.0 cc of Celestone with 0.5 cc of lidocaine. However, the patient had a dramatic and violent painful reaction to the introduction of the needle with contortions of the hand and with dangerously withdrawing the hand with concerns for secondary needle stick. Therefore, the needle was withdrawn. The patient was counseled as to the importance of attempting to get some therapeutic steroid in the flexor tendon sheath. We attempted a 2nd time for a similar injection using the same technique with 1.0 cc of Celestone and 0.5 cc of lidocaine. There was a small palmar vein that bled a scant amount, which was cleaned up off the back of the patient's hand. A Band-Aid was applied. He was reassured on multiple occasions that no harm was done to his finger. I recommended icing it this evening and taking ibuprofen.

Right index finger hyperextension injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Philip Gutierrez is a pleasant 50-year-old right-hand-dominant male here today for a 2nd opinion regarding evaluation of the right index finger hyperextension injury sustained during a motor vehicle accident in 03/2021.

In summary, the patient was the passenger in a vehicle that was rear-ended. He reports they were hit multiple times as he felt 2 bumps which caused his to sling forward hyperextending his right index finger. He was offered an injection of the A1 pulley region, but he did not want any steroid due to a reaction to dexamethasone that causes his heart to race. The patient was scheduled to see Dr. Alice Davis, but he has not seen his yet. The patient has been seen at Point May Orthopedics, by the physical therapy staff and a physician assistant at that practice. He underwent an MRI of the right index finger because they were concerned about a capsular strain plus or minus a rupture of the ""FDS tendon.""

The patient states that he is unable to make a fist secondary to pain and swelling in the right index finger. He describes a pulling, tearing sensation in the right index finger. The pain is exacerbated by driving. He notes that he has been wearing a right index finger splint.

The patient denies any history of diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis. He reports only taking medication for hypertension and denies taking any other chronic medications of significance. He also notes methylprednisolone causes his to itch.

Ms. Gutierrez is employed as an x-ray technician.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Musculoskeletal: Right index finger pain.
• Endocrine: Denies diabetes.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Constitutional
Very pleasant, healthy appearing, cooperative male in no distress.

Neurological
Grossly intact. Slightly diminished sensation to light touch over the right PIP joint of the index finger compared to the middle finger.

Cardiovascular
Regular rate and rhythm.

Musculoskeletal
Exam of the right hand, there is no swelling or ecchymosis in the palm on the volar surface of his index finger. Normal creases are noted. Index finger rests in a 10 degree PIP joint flexed position with discomfort upon correction. Bilateral extremities 2+ radial pulses.

RESULTS

X-rays today, 4 views of the right hand, show no bony abnormalities. Joint congruency throughout all lesser digits on the right hand. No soft tissue shadows of concern. No arthritis.

MRI of the right index finger performed on 04/24/2021. Independent review of the images shows focal soft tissue swelling over the right index MCP joint, partial-thickness tear of the right FDS, and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the FDP and FDS tendons. Radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index MCP joint were intact as was the MCP joint capsule. The extensor tendons were also deemed intact.

ASSESSMENT

• Stenosing tenosynovitis of right index finger.

Ms. Philip Gutierrez is a pleasant 50-year-old right-hand-dominant male here today for a 2nd opinion of his right index finger hyperextension injury sustained during a motor vehicle accident in March of this year.

Radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index MCP joint were intact as was the MCP joint capsule. The extensor tendons were also deemed intact.

ASSESSMENT

• Stenosing tenosynovitis of right index finger.

Ms. Philip Gutierrez is a pleasant 50-year-old right-hand-dominant male here today for a 2nd opinion of his right index finger hyperextension injury sustained during a motor vehicle accident in March of this year. The findings of his examination are consistent with rather severe post-traumatic stenosing tenosynovitis.

PLAN

The patient and I had a lengthy discussion regarding his history, symptoms, and radiographic findings. We discussed the pathophysiology and natural history of stenosing tenosynovitis and the anatomy of the flexor tendons and pulley system in the hand. I explained to the patient that the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon was clearly intact and that He is suffering from post-traumatic inflammation around the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon blocking excursion of the flexor tendons to the A1 pulley.

Treatment options were discussed including conservative management with corticosteroid injections and their statistical effectiveness. Surgical correction was also briefly discussed, although I recommend exhausting non-operative measures with a minimum of 2 injections before proceeding with surgery. I recommended a right index trigger finger cortisone injection today, and the patient elected to proceed. I also recommend that the patient report to occupational therapy once a week for the next 6 weeks to work on full active and passive right index finger range of motion with no restrictions.

The patient verbalizes understanding with the treatment plan and agrees. All questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction today.

PROCEDURE

Right index trigger finger injection.
The patient understands the risks and benefits and elected to proceed, signed consent obtained. An attempt was made to inject 1.0 cc of Celestone with 0.5 cc of lidocaine. However, the patient had a dramatic and violent painful reaction to the introduction of the needle with contortions of the hand and with dangerously withdrawing the hand with concerns for secondary needle stick. Therefore, the needle was withdrawn. The patient was counseled as to the importance of attempting to get some therapeutic steroid in the flexor tendon sheath. We attempted a 2nd time for a similar injection using the same technique with 1.0 cc of Celestone and 0.5 cc of lidocaine. There was a small palmar vein that bled a scant amount, which was cleaned up off the back of the patient's hand. A Band-Aid was applied. He was reassured on multiple occasions that no harm was done to his finger. I recommended icing it this evening and taking ibuprofen.

Right index finger hyperextension injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Philip Gutierrez is a pleasant 50-year-old right-hand-dominant male here today for a 2nd opinion regarding evaluation of the right index finger hyperextension injury sustained during a motor vehicle accident in 03/2021.

In summary, the patient was the passenger in a vehicle that was rear-ended. He reports they were hit multiple times as he felt 2 bumps which caused his to sling forward hyperextending his right index finger. He was offered an injection of the A1 pulley region, but he did not want any steroid due to a reaction to dexamethasone that causes his heart to race. The patient was scheduled to see Dr. Alice Davis, but he has not seen his yet. The patient has been seen at Point May Orthopedics, by the physical therapy staff and a physician assistant at that practice. He underwent an MRI of the right index finger because they were concerned about a capsular strain plus or minus a rupture of the ""FDS tendon.""

The patient states that he is unable to make a fist secondary to pain and swelling in the right index finger. He describes a pulling, tearing sensation in the right index finger. The pain is exacerbated by driving. He notes that he has been wearing a right index finger splint.

The patient denies any history of diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis. He reports only taking medication for hypertension and denies taking any other chronic medications of significance. He also notes methylprednisolone causes his to itch.

Ms. Gutierrez is employed as an x-ray technician.

Grossly intact. Slightly diminished sensation to light touch over the right PIP joint of the index finger compared to the middle finger.

Cardiovascular
Regular rate and rhythm.

Musculoskeletal
Exam of the right hand, there is no swelling or ecchymosis in the palm on the volar surface of his index finger. Normal creases are noted. Index finger rests in a 10 degree PIP joint flexed position with discomfort upon correction. Bilateral extremities 2+ radial pulses.

RESULTS

X-rays today, 4 views of the right hand, show no bony abnormalities. Joint congruency throughout all lesser digits on the right hand. No soft tissue shadows of concern. No arthritis.

MRI of the right index finger performed on 04/24/2021. Independent review of the images shows focal soft tissue swelling over the right index MCP joint, partial-thickness tear of the right FDS, and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the FDP and FDS tendons. Radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index MCP joint were intact as was the MCP joint capsule. The extensor tendons were also deemed intact.

ASSESSMENT

• Stenosing tenosynovitis of right index finger.

Ms. Philip Gutierrez is a pleasant 50-year-old right-hand-dominant male here today for a 2nd opinion of his right index finger hyperextension injury sustained during a motor vehicle accident in March of this year. The findings of his examination are consistent with rather severe post-traumatic stenosing tenosynovitis.

PLAN

The patient and I had a lengthy discussion regarding his history, symptoms, and radiographic findings. We discussed the pathophysiology and natural history of stenosing tenosynovitis and the anatomy of the flexor tendons and pulley system in the hand. I explained to the patient that the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon was clearly intact and that He is suffering from post-traumatic inflammation around the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon blocking excursion of the flexor tendons to the A1 pulley.

Treatment options were discussed including conservative management with corticosteroid injections and their statistical effectiveness. Surgical correction was also briefly discussed, although I recommend exhausting non-operative measures with a minimum of 2 injections before proceeding with surgery. I recommended a right index trigger finger cortisone injection today, and the patient elected to proceed. I also recommend that the patient report to occupational therapy once a week for the next 6 weeks to work on full active and passive right index finger range of motion with no restrictions.

The patient verbalizes understanding with the treatment plan and agrees. All questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction today.

PROCEDURE

Right index trigger finger injection.
The patient understands the risks and benefits and elected to proceed, signed consent obtained. An attempt was made to inject 1.0 cc of Celestone with 0.5 cc of lidocaine. However, the patient had a dramatic and violent painful reaction to the introduction of the needle with contortions of the hand and with dangerously withdrawing the hand with concerns for secondary needle stick. Therefore, the needle was withdrawn. The patient was counseled as to the importance of attempting to get some therapeutic steroid in the flexor tendon sheath. We attempted a 2nd time for a similar injection using the same technique with 1.0 cc of Celestone and 0.5 cc of lidocaine. There was a small palmar vein that bled a scant amount, which was cleaned up off the back of the patient's hand. A Band-Aid was applied. He was reassured on multiple occasions that no harm was done to his finger. I recommended icing it this evening and taking ibuprofen.

INSTRUCTIONS

Occupational therapy as prescribed.
",21,16,"[doctor] so what i would recommend, what we try, is a cortisone injection, and i would avoid the dexamethasone because i saw you have a little reaction to that, but we could use the betamethasone, which is a celestone.
[patient] i have gotten anoth methylprednisolone and that itched me crazy.
[doctor] did it. ye, this one is wat-soluble and i think it is fairly low toxicity but high benefit, and i think decreasing the pain will encourage you to move that fing.
[patient] all right, we will give it a try."

Right index finger hyperextension injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Philip Gutierrez is a pleasant 50-year-old right-hand-dominant male here today for a 2nd opinion regarding evaluation of the right index finger hyperextension injury sustained during a motor vehicle accident in 03/2021.

In summary, the patient was the passenger in a vehicle that was rear-ended. He reports they were hit multiple times as he felt 2 bumps which caused his to sling forward hyperextending his right index finger. He was offered an injection of the A1 pulley region, but he did not want any steroid due to a reaction to dexamethasone that causes his heart to race. The patient was scheduled to see Dr. Alice Davis, but he has not seen his yet. The patient has been seen at Point May Orthopedics, by the physical therapy staff and a physician assistant at that practice. He underwent an MRI of the right index finger because they were concerned about a capsular strain plus or minus a rupture of the ""FDS tendon.""

The patient states that he is unable to make a fist secondary to pain and swelling in the right index finger. He describes a pulling, tearing sensation in the right index finger. The pain is exacerbated by driving. He notes that he has been wearing a right index finger splint.

The patient denies any history of diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis. He reports only taking medication for hypertension and denies taking any other chronic medications of significance. He also notes methylprednisolone causes his to itch.

Ms. Gutierrez is employed as an x-ray technician.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Musculoskeletal: Right index finger pain.
• Endocrine: Denies diabetes.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Constitutional
Very pleasant, healthy appearing, cooperative male in no distress.

Neurological
Grossly intact. Slightly diminished sensation to light touch over the right PIP joint of the index finger compared to the middle finger.

Cardiovascular
Regular rate and rhythm.

Musculoskeletal
Exam of the right hand, there is no swelling or ecchymosis in the palm on the volar surface of his index finger. Normal creases are noted. Index finger rests in a 10 degree PIP joint flexed position with discomfort upon correction. Bilateral extremities 2+ radial pulses.

RESULTS

X-rays today, 4 views of the right hand, show no bony abnormalities. Joint congruency throughout all lesser digits on the right hand. No soft tissue shadows of concern. No arthritis.

MRI of the right index finger performed on 04/24/2021. Independent review of the images shows focal soft tissue swelling over the right index MCP joint, partial-thickness tear of the right FDS, and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the FDP and FDS tendons. Radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index MCP joint were intact as was the MCP joint capsule. The extensor tendons were also deemed intact.

ASSESSMENT

• Stenosing tenosynovitis of right index finger.

Ms. Philip Gutierrez is a pleasant 50-year-old right-hand-dominant male here today for a 2nd opinion of his right index finger hyperextension injury sustained during a motor vehicle accident in March of this year. The findings of his examination are consistent with rather severe post-traumatic stenosing tenosynovitis.

PLAN

The patient and I had a lengthy discussion regarding his history, symptoms, and radiographic findings. We discussed the pathophysiology and natural history of stenosing tenosynovitis and the anatomy of the flexor tendons and pulley system in the hand. I explained to the patient that the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon was clearly intact and that He is suffering from post-traumatic inflammation around the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon blocking excursion of the flexor tendons to the A1 pulley.

Treatment options were discussed including conservative management with corticosteroid injections and their statistical effectiveness. Surgical correction was also briefly discussed, although I recommend exhausting non-operative measures with a minimum of 2 injections before proceeding with surgery. I recommended a right index trigger finger cortisone injection today, and the patient elected to proceed. I also recommend that the patient report to occupational therapy once a week for the next 6 weeks to work on full active and passive right index finger range of motion with no restrictions.

The patient verbalizes understanding with the treatment plan and agrees. All questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction today.

PROCEDURE

Right index trigger finger injection.
The patient understands the risks and benefits and elected to proceed, signed consent obtained. An attempt was made to inject 1.0 cc of Celestone with 0.5 cc of lidocaine. However, the patient had a dramatic and violent painful reaction to the introduction of the needle with contortions of the hand and with dangerously withdrawing the hand with concerns for secondary needle stick. Therefore, the needle was withdrawn. The patient was counseled as to the importance of attempting to get some therapeutic steroid in the flexor tendon sheath. We attempted a 2nd time for a similar injection using the same technique with 1.0 cc of Celestone and 0.5 cc of lidocaine. There was a small palmar vein that bled a scant amount, which was cleaned up off the back of the patient's hand. A Band-Aid was applied. He was reassured on multiple occasions that no harm was done to his finger. I recommended icing it this evening and taking ibuprofen.

INSTRUCTIONS

Occupational therapy as prescribed.
",21,22,"[doctor] ye, so i'll write you out an outpatient prescription. i think if you go back to the same people whe you, we, before, i am hoping that aft this injection, you are going to be able to do a whole lot more with them. so let's do outpatient once a week for six weeks and then full active and passive range of motion is the goal, with no restrictions.
[patient] all right, sounds a plan.
[doctor] all right, i will have the nurse set up the injection procedure and we will, and i'll be back shortly.

Right index finger hyperextension injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Philip Gutierrez is a pleasant 50-year-old right-hand-dominant male here today for a 2nd opinion regarding evaluation of the right index finger hyperextension injury sustained during a motor vehicle accident in 03/2021.

In summary, the patient was the passenger in a vehicle that was rear-ended. He reports they were hit multiple times as he felt 2 bumps which caused his to sling forward hyperextending his right index finger. He was offered an injection of the A1 pulley region, but he did not want any steroid due to a reaction to dexamethasone that causes his heart to race. The patient was scheduled to see Dr. Alice Davis, but he has not seen his yet. The patient has been seen at Point May Orthopedics, by the physical therapy staff and a physician assistant at that practice. He underwent an MRI of the right index finger because they were concerned about a capsular strain plus or minus a rupture of the ""FDS tendon.""

The patient states that he is unable to make a fist secondary to pain and swelling in the right index finger. He describes a pulling, tearing sensation in the right index finger. The pain is exacerbated by driving. He notes that he has been wearing a right index finger splint.

Hypogonadism.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Paul Edwards is a 59-year-old male, an established patient, who presents to the clinic today for hypogonadism. He was last seen on 11/24/2020. The patient’s history includes positive for HIV, and today he is concerned with gynecomastia.

The patient is doing well, overall, and feels the testosterone is helping. He reports weight stability, feels lively, good, more vigorous, and he is sleeping well. He also thinks the testosterone is having a positive effect on his blood work. He endorses that his triglycerides have always been elevated and adds that they were as high as 265 mg/dL. The patient presented a copy of his bloodwork, showing a significant decrease in his cholesterol after 5 months. Mr. Edwards questioned if the changes in his blood work were due to the testosterone. He also noted that his red blood cell count has not increased. The patient inquired about possible benefits of Indole-3-carbinol, which is a broccoli extract for estrogen control.

Currently, the patient is dosing 140 ng/dL of testosterone per week and inquired if his dose could be increased to 175 ng/dL. He recalled that he had recently injected testosterone before his last testosterone blood work was performed; last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL. The patient confirms continued daily use of Finasteride and Cialis, prescribed by me, and stated he needs a refill for both.

Mr. Edwards mentioned he is taking correct steps to get his life ""together."" He also uses a med calendar to help with medication compliance.

He requested an increase to his testosterone cypionate from 140 mg to 175 mg, which I denied due to his already high testosterone levels. I counseled the patient on the risks associated with high testosterone levels and Indole-3-carbinol and it’s lacking evidence to support his estrogen levels. The last time his estradiol levels were checked, they were normal; recommend annual screening.

PLAN

I recommend maintaining current management. The patient’s last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL, although this level was likely related to his recent injection. He requested an increase to his testosterone cypionate from 140 mg to 175 mg, which I denied due to his already high testosterone levels. I counseled the patient on the risks associated with high testosterone levels and Indole-3-carbinol and it’s lacking evidence to support his estrogen levels. The last time his estradiol levels were checked, they were normal; recommend annual screening.

I provided paper prescription refills for Cialis and Finasteride.

Hypogonadism.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Paul Edwards is a 59-year-old male, an established patient, who presents to the clinic today for hypogonadism. He was last seen on 11/24/2020. The patient’s history includes positive for HIV, and today he is concerned with gynecomastia.

The patient is doing well, overall, and feels the testosterone is helping. He reports weight stability, feels lively, good, more vigorous, and he is sleeping well. He also thinks the testosterone is having a positive effect on his blood work. He endorses that his triglycerides have always been elevated and adds that they were as high as 265 mg/dL. The patient presented a copy of his bloodwork, showing a significant decrease in his cholesterol after 5 months. Mr. Edwards questioned if the changes in his blood work were due to the testosterone. He also noted that his red blood cell count has not increased. The patient inquired about possible benefits of Indole-3-carbinol, which is a broccoli extract for estrogen control.

Currently, the patient is dosing 140 ng/dL of testosterone per week and inquired if his dose could be increased to 175 ng/dL. He recalled that he had recently injected testosterone before his last testosterone blood work was performed; last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL. The patient confirms continued daily use of Finasteride and Cialis, prescribed by me, and stated he needs a refill for both.

Mr. Edwards mentioned he is taking correct steps to get his life ""together."" He also uses a med calendar to help with medication compliance.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Nicole Miller is a 71-year-old female who presents for follow-up. The patient was called in for a follow up with me for chronic congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction. Her BNP had been 3000 in 03/2021, up to 6000 in 04/2021. She was increasingly dyspneic. We had changed her furosemide to torsemide at 20 mg by mouth daily. The patient is not on a potassium supplement currently. Her lisinopril had also been increased up to 10 mg daily in 03/2021.

I last saw her in 04/2021, and she had reported being interested in having her right knee replaced this summer at East Metropolitan Hospital, so it was recommended that we work to control her cardiovascular status prior to surgery. She is currently scheduled to have surgery on 06/24/2021. She plans to discontinue clopidogrel a week before her surgery.

The patient states that she has lost approximately 3 to 3.5 pounds since her last visit in 04/2021. Some of which may be water weight decreasing. She did report experiencing bilateral leg cramps which she treated with consumption of pickle juice, which did resolve the cramps. She thought the cramps were related to her being cold.

She is still taking iron supplementation. She denies any concerns with defecation.

Regarding her prior symptoms of heartburn, she denies any recent gastrointestinal issues. She notes that her heartburn was severe at one point but resolved after trying Prilosec for 2 weeks in 01/2021. She denies any issues with heartburn since that time and has stopped taking Prilosec altogether. She has since transitioned back to her original ""stomach medication"".

The patient is due for a colonoscopy. She is currently double covered with Medicare and private insurance.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Chronic Congestive Heart Failure.
Iron deficiency Anemia.

Medications

FAMILY HISTORY

No family history of colon cancer.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Torsemide 20 mg by mouth daily.
Lisinopril 10 mg daily.

RESULTS

Magnesium 1.7, hemoglobin WNL, potassium 3.9, creatinine 0.7, BUN 23.

PLAN

Chronic congestive heart failure with mixed presentation.
She had an exacerbation of CHF earlier in the spring. We switched her from furosemide to torsemide and symptomatically, she is doing a lot better. She is about 1.5 kg down in weight. Her breathing is nonlabored. We are going to repeat an EKG today. Otherwise, continue her current regimen. Labs were checked and creatinine is appropriate. Her magnesium is below the preferred 2 at 1.7, with some occurrence of bilateral leg cramping, therefore we will start her on magnesium supplement.

Preop examination.
She is going to be having a right knee replacement at the end of 06/2021. We will schedule a preop check the first week or two of June prior to the surgery. She will discontinue clopidogrel for one week prior to knee replacement surgery; we will provide a reminder to patient of this as well.

Diabetes mellitus.
A1c is 5.5 on last check, so there is no need for a further A1c today. She may need another one prior to her surgery next month.

Colonoscopy.
The patient is overdue for a colonoscopy, which we will try to have done at County Hospital in the next month, prior to a change in her insurance. This is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for. No family history of colon cancer.

The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

She denies any issues with heartburn since that time and has stopped taking Prilosec altogether. She has since transitioned back to her original ""stomach medication"".

The patient is due for a colonoscopy. She is currently double covered with Medicare and private insurance.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Chronic Congestive Heart Failure.
Iron deficiency Anemia.

Medications
Prilosec.

FAMILY HISTORY

No family history of colon cancer.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Torsemide 20 mg by mouth daily.
Lisinopril 10 mg daily.

RESULTS

Magnesium 1.7, hemoglobin WNL, potassium 3.9, creatinine 0.7, BUN 23.
03/2020 Hgb A1c 5.5.

ASSESSMENT

• Chronic congestive heart failure with mixed presentation.
• Preop examination.
• Diabetes mellitus.
• Colonoscopy

PLAN

Chronic congestive heart failure with mixed presentation.
She had an exacerbation of CHF earlier in the spring. We switched her from furosemide to torsemide and symptomatically, she is doing a lot better. She is about 1.5 kg down in weight. Her breathing is nonlabored. We are going to repeat an EKG today. Otherwise, continue her current regimen. Labs were checked and creatinine is appropriate. Her magnesium is below the preferred 2 at 1.7, with some occurrence of bilateral leg cramping, therefore we will start her on magnesium supplement.

Preop examination.
She is going to be having a right knee replacement at the end of 06/2021. We will schedule a preop check the first week or two of June prior to the surgery. She will discontinue clopidogrel for one week prior to knee replacement surgery; we will provide a reminder to patient of this as well.

Diabetes mellitus.
A1c is 5.5 on last check, so there is no need for a further A1c today. She may need another one prior to her surgery next month.

Colonoscopy.
The patient is overdue for a colonoscopy, which we will try to have done at County Hospital in the next month, prior to a change in her insurance. This is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for. No family history of colon cancer.

The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

Complete EKG today. Schedule a preop checkup 1st or 2nd week of June. Start magnesium supplement. Call the clinic with any questions or new symptoms.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Nicole Miller is a 71-year-old female who presents for follow-up. The patient was called in for a follow up with me for chronic congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction. Her BNP had been 3000 in 03/2021, up to 6000 in 04/2021. She was increasingly dyspneic. We had changed her furosemide to torsemide at 20 mg by mouth daily. The patient is not on a potassium supplement currently. Her lisinopril had also been increased up to 10 mg daily in 03/2021.

I last saw her in 04/2021, and she had reported being interested in having her right knee replaced this summer at East Metropolitan Hospital, so it was recommended that we work to control her cardiovascular status prior to surgery. She is currently scheduled to have surgery on 06/24/2021. She plans to discontinue clopidogrel a week before her surgery.

The patient states that she has lost approximately 3 to 3.5 pounds since her last visit in 04/2021. Some of which may be water weight decreasing. She did report experiencing bilateral leg cramps which she treated with consumption of pickle juice, which did resolve the cramps. She thought the cramps were related to her being cold.

She is still taking iron supplementation. She denies any concerns with defecation.

Regarding her prior symptoms of heartburn, she denies any recent gastrointestinal issues. She notes that her heartburn was severe at one point but resolved after trying Prilosec for 2 weeks in 01/2021.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Nicole Miller is a 71-year-old female who presents for follow-up. The patient was called in for a follow up with me for chronic congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction. Her BNP had been 3000 in 03/2021, up to 6000 in 04/2021. She was increasingly dyspneic. We had changed her furosemide to torsemide at 20 mg by mouth daily. The patient is not on a potassium supplement currently. Her lisinopril had also been increased up to 10 mg daily in 03/2021.

I last saw her in 04/2021, and she had reported being interested in having her right knee replaced this summer at East Metropolitan Hospital, so it was recommended that we work to control her cardiovascular status prior to surgery. She is currently scheduled to have surgery on 06/24/2021. She plans to discontinue clopidogrel a week before her surgery.

The patient states that she has lost approximately 3 to 3.5 pounds since her last visit in 04/2021. Some of which may be water weight decreasing. She did report experiencing bilateral leg cramps which she treated with consumption of pickle juice, which did resolve the cramps. She thought the cramps were related to her being cold.

She is still taking iron supplementation. She denies any concerns with defecation.

Regarding her prior symptoms of heartburn, she denies any recent gastrointestinal issues. She notes that her heartburn was severe at one point but resolved after trying Prilosec for 2 weeks in 01/2021. She denies any issues with heartburn since that time and has stopped taking Prilosec altogether. She has since transitioned back to her original ""stomach medication"".

The patient is due for a colonoscopy. She is currently double covered with Medicare and private insurance.

Left arm pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

He reports that his left arm pain began approximately 2 weeks ago. He woke around 2:00 am with intense pain in his left arm and hand. He applied ice and after 2-3 hours, the pain improved and he was able to go back to sleep, the pain did not return until that evening. After several nights of experiencing the left arm and hand pain, he was seen by Betty Ross, PA-C. She suspected a pinched nerve and completed x-rays of the cervical spine, prescribed gabapentin and prednisone, and referred the patient to us. The patient has benefited from the gabapentin and prednisone, reporting improvement of pain at night.

The pain initially was encountered at night, but the patient notes that the symptoms carry into the next day. He denies pain when moving his neck, turning his head, and moving his shoulder.

Mr. Clark does report a history of a left finger injury, stating “it rarely works”, and neuropathy in one leg from his knee to his foot which he receives 1% disability for. The patient is a veteran.

Left arm pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

He reports that his left arm pain began approximately 2 weeks ago. He woke around 2:00 am with intense pain in his left arm and hand. He applied ice and after 2-3 hours, the pain improved and he was able to go back to sleep, the pain did not return until that evening. After several nights of experiencing the left arm and hand pain, he was seen by Betty Ross, PA-C. She suspected a pinched nerve and completed x-rays of the cervical spine, prescribed gabapentin and prednisone, and referred the patient to us. The patient has benefited from the gabapentin and prednisone, reporting improvement of pain at night.

The pain initially was encountered at night, but the patient notes that the symptoms carry into the next day. He denies pain when moving his neck, turning his head, and moving his shoulder.

Mr. Clark does report a history of a left finger injury, stating “it rarely works”, and neuropathy in one leg from his knee to his foot which he receives 1% disability for. The patient is a veteran.

Routine follow up of chronic medical conditions.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Eugene Walker is a 61-year-old male who presents today for a routine follow-up of his chronic medical conditions.

Today, the patient reports feeling more fatigued as of late. He notes that he usually rides his bike for about 20 to 30 miles and by the end of his ride he is tired enough that he will immediately fall asleep. The patient adds that he can fall asleep easily and gets about 6 or 7 hours of sleep per night. He believes he snores a bit but denies any signs of apnea.

Of note, the patient underwent an aortic valve replacement and ascending aortic aneurysm repair on 01/22/2013. As he is now 8 years post-op, he has requested an echocardiogram from Dr. Lewis to review how he is doing currently. His last stress test was performed on 09/09/2019.

Mr. Walker reports that his wife and friends have told him that he has pursed lips when he walks. This has also been noticed by his other providers. He denies any wheezing.

Furthermore, the patient has noticed a 2 to 3 mm nodule in his right testicle, possibly with the epididymis but he is unsure. He has not had a vasectomy.

His current medication list only consists of clindamycin prior to dental procedures and vitamin D3 (50,000 IU on Sundays and 2000 IU the other 6 days).

From a preventative standpoint, the patient is due for the shingles vaccine and an MMR titer. He is fully vaccinated for COVID-19 with his first dose on 01/15/2021 and his second dose on 02/05/2021.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
Pursed lip breathing noted. The exhalation phase is low. Lungs are clear to auscultation, no wheezing.

Genitourinary
No hernia noted. Left testicle normal.

RESULTS

Regarding his blood work from 04/10/2021, the patient's alkaline phosphatase was elevated at 156. His lipid panel showed elevated total cholesterol of 247, HDL 66, LDL 166, and triglycerides 74. The patient's TSH was normal at 2.68. His CBC was unremarkable. His most recent vitamin D level was at the high end of normal at 94.

ASSESSMENT

• History of aortic aneurysm repair.
• Elevated alkaline phosphate level.
• Lung field abnormal finding on examination.
• Right testicular nodule.
• Preventative health.

PLAN

Mr. Eugene Walker is a 61-year-old male who presents today for a routine follow-up of his chronic medical conditions.

Routine follow up of chronic medical conditions.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Eugene Walker is a 61-year-old male who presents today for a routine follow-up of his chronic medical conditions.

Today, the patient reports feeling more fatigued as of late. He notes that he usually rides his bike for about 20 to 30 miles and by the end of his ride he is tired enough that he will immediately fall asleep. The patient adds that he can fall asleep easily and gets about 6 or 7 hours of sleep per night. He believes he snores a bit but denies any signs of apnea.

Of note, the patient underwent an aortic valve replacement and ascending aortic aneurysm repair on 01/22/2013. As he is now 8 years post-op, he has requested an echocardiogram from Dr. Lewis to review how he is doing currently. His last stress test was performed on 09/09/2019.

Mr. Walker reports that his wife and friends have told him that he has pursed lips when he walks. This has also been noticed by his other providers. He denies any wheezing.

Furthermore, the patient has noticed a 2 to 3 mm nodule in his right testicle, possibly with the epididymis but he is unsure. He has not had a vasectomy.

His current medication list only consists of clindamycin prior to dental procedures and vitamin D3 (50,000 IU on Sundays and 2000 IU the other 6 days).

From a preventative standpoint, the patient is due for the shingles vaccine and an MMR titer. He is fully vaccinated for COVID-19 with his first dose on 01/15/2021 and his second dose on 02/05/2021.

Routine follow up of chronic medical conditions.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Eugene Walker is a 61-year-old male who presents today for a routine follow-up of his chronic medical conditions.

Today, the patient reports feeling more fatigued as of late. He notes that he usually rides his bike for about 20 to 30 miles and by the end of his ride he is tired enough that he will immediately fall asleep. The patient adds that he can fall asleep easily and gets about 6 or 7 hours of sleep per night. He believes he snores a bit but denies any signs of apnea.

Of note, the patient underwent an aortic valve replacement and ascending aortic aneurysm repair on 01/22/2013. As he is now 8 years post-op, he has requested an echocardiogram from Dr. Lewis to review how he is doing currently. His last stress test was performed on 09/09/2019.

Mr. Walker reports that his wife and friends have told him that he has pursed lips when he walks. This has also been noticed by his other providers. He denies any wheezing.

Furthermore, the patient has noticed a 2 to 3 mm nodule in his right testicle, possibly with the epididymis but he is unsure. He has not had a vasectomy.

His current medication list only consists of clindamycin prior to dental procedures and vitamin D3 (50,000 IU on Sundays and 2000 IU the other 6 days).

From a preventative standpoint, the patient is due for the shingles vaccine and an MMR titer. He is fully vaccinated for COVID-19 with his first dose on 01/15/2021 and his second dose on 02/05/2021.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
Pursed lip breathing noted. The exhalation phase is low. Lungs are clear to auscultation, no wheezing.

Abdominal pain and diarrhea.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Patrick Allen is a 42-year-old male who presents for a new patient visit for chronic abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea.

Mr. Allen reports experiencing intermittent mid-abdominal pain for approximately 2 years. The pain is localized just inferior to the umbilicus and he describes it as a “nagging feeling” when it is present. The pain sometimes improves following a bowel movement. Unfortunately, Mr. Allen reports that the pain has been present more often in the past 2 months. In 01/2020, the patient presented to the emergency room due to the pain and underwent a CT scan.

In addition to the abdominal pain, Mr. Allen complains of constipation and episodic severe diarrhea for the past 2 months; however, he estimates that the constipation is more frequent than the diarrhea. When he is constipated, he has a bowel movement 3-4 times a week and the stools are hard. Regarding his diarrhea, he has noticed that it seems to be associated with certain foods. In particular, he notes that pasta with a creamy sauce is likely to prompt an episode of diarrhea. When this occurs, he usually has just 1 bowel movement of diarrhea and then it resolves. The patient states that, prior to 2 months ago, his bowel movements were normal. Mr. Allen notes that massaging his abdomen has sometimes been helpful in producing a bowel movement.

The patient’s last physical was 4 months ago, and he confirms that he did have bloodwork that day. Mr. Allen reports that his primary care provider notified him that his AST and ALT were mildly elevated and advised that they would need to recheck his liver enzymes in 6 months. The patient’s medication list includes Crestor and olmesartan daily and he estimates that he has been taking the Crestor for approximately 18 months. He also takes Tylenol as needed for pain, approximately once a month. The patient states that he drinks 2 beers once a week and denies a history of heavy alcohol or drug use. He also denies excessive bruising or bleeding and any lower extremity edema.

The patient denies blood in his stools, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, and indigestion. He confirms that he is eating and drinking normally, and his weight has been stable. He does acknowledge that he would like to lose 25 pounds, however. He has no family history of gastrointestinal cancer or liver disease; however, his sister has irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The patient has not had any prior abdominal surgeries and he has never had a colonoscopy.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
No murmurs, gallops, or rubs.

Abdomen
Normoactive bowel sounds in all 4 quadrants. There is mild left periumbilical tenderness to palpation, mild hepatomegaly, and increased stool burden in colon.

RESULTS

CT of Abdomen, 01/23/2020.
Impression: Normal CT of abdomen.

ASSESSMENT

• Constipation
• Mild hepatomegaly

PLAN

Patrick Allen is a 42-year-old male who presents for a new patient visit for chronic abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea. The most likely etiology of his abdominal pain is constipation given his history, exam with increased stool burden, and normal abdominal CT. Mild hepatomegaly was also noted on exam today and the patient reportedly had elevated liver enzymes on labs with his primary care provider 4 months ago. The patient is currently on Crestor which may be contributing to his elevated liver enzymes. We discussed findings, diagnosis, and next steps at length.

Constipation
• Start daily fiber supplement and increase water consumption to at least 48 ounces daily to help with bowel regularity.
• Avoid trigger foods that may cause episodes of diarrhea.

Mild Hepatomegaly
• Repeat liver enzyme labs today.
• Schedule a liver ultrasound pending lab results.
• Encouraged to cease alcohol consumption.
• Patient to contact his PCP to discuss alternative medications.

When he is constipated, he has a bowel movement 3-4 times a week and the stools are hard. Regarding his diarrhea, he has noticed that it seems to be associated with certain foods. In particular, he notes that pasta with a creamy sauce is likely to prompt an episode of diarrhea. When this occurs, he usually has just 1 bowel movement of diarrhea and then it resolves. The patient states that, prior to 2 months ago, his bowel movements were normal. Mr. Allen notes that massaging his abdomen has sometimes been helpful in producing a bowel movement.

The patient’s last physical was 4 months ago, and he confirms that he did have bloodwork that day. Mr. Allen reports that his primary care provider notified him that his AST and ALT were mildly elevated and advised that they would need to recheck his liver enzymes in 6 months. The patient’s medication list includes Crestor and olmesartan daily and he estimates that he has been taking the Crestor for approximately 18 months. He also takes Tylenol as needed for pain, approximately once a month. The patient states that he drinks 2 beers once a week and denies a history of heavy alcohol or drug use. He also denies excessive bruising or bleeding and any lower extremity edema.

The patient denies blood in his stools, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, and indigestion. He confirms that he is eating and drinking normally, and his weight has been stable. He does acknowledge that he would like to lose 25 pounds, however. He has no family history of gastrointestinal cancer or liver disease; however, his sister has irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The patient has not had any prior abdominal surgeries and he has never had a colonoscopy.

PLAN

Patrick Allen is a 42-year-old male who presents for a new patient visit for chronic abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea. The most likely etiology of his abdominal pain is constipation given his history, exam with increased stool burden, and normal abdominal CT. Mild hepatomegaly was also noted on exam today and the patient reportedly had elevated liver enzymes on labs with his primary care provider 4 months ago. The patient is currently on Crestor which may be contributing to his elevated liver enzymes. We discussed findings, diagnosis, and next steps at length.

Constipation
• Start daily fiber supplement and increase water consumption to at least 48 ounces daily to help with bowel regularity.
• Avoid trigger foods that may cause episodes of diarrhea.

Mild Hepatomegaly
• Repeat liver enzyme labs today.
• Schedule a liver ultrasound pending lab results.
• Encouraged to cease alcohol consumption.
• Patient to contact his PCP to discuss alternative medications.

Abdominal pain and diarrhea.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Patrick Allen is a 42-year-old male who presents for a new patient visit for chronic abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea.

Mr. Allen reports experiencing intermittent mid-abdominal pain for approximately 2 years. The pain is localized just inferior to the umbilicus and he describes it as a “nagging feeling” when it is present. The pain sometimes improves following a bowel movement. Unfortunately, Mr. Allen reports that the pain has been present more often in the past 2 months. In 01/2020, the patient presented to the emergency room due to the pain and underwent a CT scan.

In addition to the abdominal pain, Mr. Allen complains of constipation and episodic severe diarrhea for the past 2 months; however, he estimates that the constipation is more frequent than the diarrhea. When he is constipated, he has a bowel movement 3-4 times a week and the stools are hard. Regarding his diarrhea, he has noticed that it seems to be associated with certain foods. In particular, he notes that pasta with a creamy sauce is likely to prompt an episode of diarrhea. When this occurs, he usually has just 1 bowel movement of diarrhea and then it resolves. The patient states that, prior to 2 months ago, his bowel movements were normal. Mr. Allen notes that massaging his abdomen has sometimes been helpful in producing a bowel movement.

The patient’s last physical was 4 months ago, and he confirms that he did have bloodwork that day. Mr. Allen reports that his primary care provider notified him that his AST and ALT were mildly elevated and advised that they would need to recheck his liver enzymes in 6 months. The patient’s medication list includes Crestor and olmesartan daily and he estimates that he has been taking the Crestor for approximately 18 months. He also takes Tylenol as needed for pain, approximately once a month. The patient states that he drinks 2 beers once a week and denies a history of heavy alcohol or drug use. He also denies excessive bruising or bleeding and any lower extremity edema.

The patient denies blood in his stools, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, and indigestion. He confirms that he is eating and drinking normally, and his weight has been stable. He does acknowledge that he would like to lose 25 pounds, however. He has no family history of gastrointestinal cancer or liver disease; however, his sister has irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The patient has not had any prior abdominal surgeries and he has never had a colonoscopy.

Pathology Report.

Pathology: Shave biopsy of right inferior back malignant melanoma, invasive, superficial spreading.
Histology: Superficial spreading.
Clark level: 4.
Breslow thickness: 0.7 mm.
Radial growth phase: present.
Vertical growth phase: not identified.
Mitotic figures: less than 1 mm2.
Ulceration: not identified.

Microscopic satellitosis: not identified.
Infiltrating lymphocytes: breast.

Predominant cytology: epithelioid.
Peripheral margin: positive.
Deep margin: Negative.
Stage: 1.

I reviewed the dermatologist’s photo of the lesion which showed an asymmetric black and brown nevus with central amelanotic component and irregular border.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

The patient presents today with newly diagnosed melanoma. The biopsy revealed an intermediate thickness melanoma. On examination today, there is a right inguinal lymph node with slightly atypical consistency. I recommended an ultrasound to rule out metastatic disease. If the ultrasound is normal, the patient is a candidate for a wide local excision with a 1-2 cm margin. Primary closure should be possible, but skin graft closure may be needed. The relationship between tumor histology and prognosis and treatment was carefully reviewed. The need for follow up according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines was reviewed. We also reviewed the principles of sun avoidance, skin self-examination, and the ABCDE’s of mole surveillance. After discussing the procedure, risks, expected outcomes and possible complications, questions were answered, and the patient expressed understanding and did choose to proceed.",28,1,"[doctor] next patient is sophia jackson, mrnr472348. she's a 57 year old female. who is he for a surgical consult? h dmatologist refred h. she biopsied a 0.7 millimet lesion which was located on right infior back. pathology came back as melanoma.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Hematologic/lymphatics: No axillary, cervical, or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. There is a soft lymph node in the right groin. Nontender.
Skin: On the right inferior back there is a 1 cm shave biopsy site including all of the dermis with no residual pigmentation. There’s no intrinsic or satellite lesions. No other suspicious moles.

RESULTS

Pathology Report.

Pathology: Shave biopsy of right inferior back malignant melanoma, invasive, superficial spreading.
Histology: Superficial spreading.
Clark level: 4.
Breslow thickness: 0.7 mm.
Radial growth phase: present.
Vertical growth phase: not identified.
Mitotic figures: less than 1 mm2.
Ulceration: not identified.
Regression: not identified.
Lymphatic invasion: not identified.
Perineural invasion: not identified.
Microscopic satellitosis: not identified.
Infiltrating lymphocytes: breast.
Melanocytic nevus: not identified.
Predominant cytology: epithelioid.
Peripheral margin: positive.
Deep margin: Negative.
Stage: 1.

I reviewed the dermatologist’s photo of the lesion which showed an asymmetric black and brown nevus with central amelanotic component and irregular border.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

The patient presents today with newly diagnosed melanoma. The biopsy revealed an intermediate thickness melanoma. On examination today, there is a right inguinal lymph node with slightly atypical consistency. I recommended an ultrasound to rule out metastatic disease. If the ultrasound is normal, the patient is a candidate for a wide local excision with a 1-2 cm margin. Primary closure should be possible, but skin graft closure may be needed. The relationship between tumor histology and prognosis and treatment was carefully reviewed. The need for follow up according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines was reviewed. We also reviewed the principles of sun avoidance, skin self-examination, and the ABCDE’s of mole surveillance. After discussing the procedure, risks, expected outcomes and possible complications, questions were answered, and the patient expressed understanding and did choose to proceed.",28,10,"[doctor] so assing that the ultrasound is normal. the treatment for you- melanoma- is to cut out the area whe the lesion was, with lesions that are 0.7 millimets or less, and that's what we recommend, and yours was exactly 0.7 millimets. if it we any bigg, we would have had to do a more complex surgy. but what i recommend for you is what we call a wide local incision. excuse me, excision, meaning that i will make a long incision and then cut out an area a bit wid than your current biopsy site. the incision is long because that's what allows me to close the skin nicely. you'll have a fairly long scar from the incision."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Sophia Jackson is a very pleasant 57-year-old female who presents for a surgical consult for melanoma of the right inferior back. She was referred by her dermatologist who biopsied the 0.7 mm lesion on 04/10 and diagnosed the melanoma. The lesion was initially noticed by the patient’s mother when she was visiting her last month. Mrs. Jackson denies a personal history of atypical nevi and reports that she has annual mole checks by her primary care provider at her physicals. She has never seen a dermatologist prior to last month. There is a family history of melanoma in her mother and maternal aunt. The patient reports that she has been in her usual state of health with no unintentional weight changes, headaches, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, or vision changes.

Follow-up bilateral breast cysts.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Donna Torres is a 40-year-old female who presents for follow-up surveillance of bilateral breast cysts.

The patient reports continual presence of “lumps” in bilateral breasts with some soreness. She is being seen today for surveillance of the cysts. The patient is taking progesterone, which was initially prescribed to support normalization of menstruation, which was effective. She is also still using vaginal cream one time per week which has improved symptoms of itching and discomfort.

Her last pap smear was in 2019, with negative/negative results. She did have an abnormal pap smear in 2009, which resulted in repeat pap smears per 6 months until her results normalized.

Mrs. Torres experienced increased anxiety in 11/2021 and 12/2021, stating “it was brutal” and felt she could not manage her symptoms and sought treatment. Dr. Brown started the patient on Buspar, which has successfully controlled her anxiety. The patient relates her anxiety to work related stress and possibly aging. Her work involves supporting Covid evaluation centers and clinics. She confirms receiving both Covid vaccinations. Initially, she was experiencing spikes in anxiety prior to menstruation, but her anxiety then became more random with an unclear cause. To note, the patient was started on Singulair, which the patient was told could also cause anxiety.

The patient discontinued Camila birth control, which did result in a significant increase in appetite. This has resolved and she reports she has lost weight in the past 6 months.

Follow-up bilateral breast cysts.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Donna Torres is a 40-year-old female who presents for follow-up surveillance of bilateral breast cysts.

The patient reports continual presence of “lumps” in bilateral breasts with some soreness. She is being seen today for surveillance of the cysts. The patient is taking progesterone, which was initially prescribed to support normalization of menstruation, which was effective. She is also still using vaginal cream one time per week which has improved symptoms of itching and discomfort.

Her last pap smear was in 2019, with negative/negative results. She did have an abnormal pap smear in 2009, which resulted in repeat pap smears per 6 months until her results normalized.

Mrs. Torres experienced increased anxiety in 11/2021 and 12/2021, stating “it was brutal” and felt she could not manage her symptoms and sought treatment. Dr. Brown started the patient on Buspar, which has successfully controlled her anxiety. The patient relates her anxiety to work related stress and possibly aging. Her work involves supporting Covid evaluation centers and clinics. She confirms receiving both Covid vaccinations. Initially, she was experiencing spikes in anxiety prior to menstruation, but her anxiety then became more random with an unclear cause. To note, the patient was started on Singulair, which the patient was told could also cause anxiety.

The patient discontinued Camila birth control, which did result in a significant increase in appetite. This has resolved and she reports she has lost weight in the past 6 months.

Follow-up bilateral breast cysts.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Donna Torres is a 40-year-old female who presents for follow-up surveillance of bilateral breast cysts.

The patient reports continual presence of “lumps” in bilateral breasts with some soreness. She is being seen today for surveillance of the cysts. The patient is taking progesterone, which was initially prescribed to support normalization of menstruation, which was effective. She is also still using vaginal cream one time per week which has improved symptoms of itching and discomfort.

Her last pap smear was in 2019, with negative/negative results. She did have an abnormal pap smear in 2009, which resulted in repeat pap smears per 6 months until her results normalized.

Mrs. Torres experienced increased anxiety in 11/2021 and 12/2021, stating “it was brutal” and felt she could not manage her symptoms and sought treatment. Dr. Brown started the patient on Buspar, which has successfully controlled her anxiety. The patient relates her anxiety to work related stress and possibly aging. Her work involves supporting Covid evaluation centers and clinics. She confirms receiving both Covid vaccinations. Initially, she was experiencing spikes in anxiety prior to menstruation, but her anxiety then became more random with an unclear cause. To note, the patient was started on Singulair, which the patient was told could also cause anxiety.

The patient discontinued Camila birth control, which did result in a significant increase in appetite. This has resolved and she reports she has lost weight in the past 6 months.

History of right ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Sophia Brown is a 75 y.o. female who presents today for a new patient evaluation due to her history of right DCIS. She is doing well but wishes to establish care today for continued monitoring.

The patient underwent a screening mammogram in 10/2019 and was found to have a calcification in the right breast. She then had a right breast ultrasound on 11/03/2019 which revealed a mass at the 2 o’clock position, 11 cm from the nipple, in the retroareolar region. The report states the mass was 0.4 by 2.0 by 3.0 centimeters. She subsequently had an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on 12/05/2019 and pathology results revealed grade 2 ER-positive, PR-positive DCIS. The patient then had a lumpectomy with lymphadenectomy performed on 01/20/2020. The tumor was 8 mm with negative margins and the 5 lymph nodes removed were all benign. Pathology from the tumor confirmed DCIS. Her lumpectomy was followed by adjuvant radiation therapy. Endocrine therapy was also offered but the patient declined. She has since had a mammogram in 01/2021 which was normal. The patient also reports that she performs self-breast exams regularly at home.

Mrs. Brown is a G5P5 female and estimates that her last menstrual period was approximately 30 years ago. She is not currently and has never been on hormone replacement therapy.

The patient’s last colonoscopy was done in 2018. She had a sigmoid polypectomy at that time and pathology showed a tubular adenoma.

Her cholesterol was recently noted to be elevated and the patient reports that she is exercising and reducing fatty food intake accordingly. This is being followed by her primary care provider.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Sophia Brown is a 75 y.o. female who presents today for a new patient evaluation due to her history of right DCIS. She is doing well but wishes to establish care today for continued monitoring.

The patient underwent a screening mammogram in 10/2019 and was found to have a calcification in the right breast. She then had a right breast ultrasound on 11/03/2019 which revealed a mass at the 2 o’clock position, 11 cm from the nipple, in the retroareolar region. The report states the mass was 0.4 by 2.0 by 3.0 centimeters. She subsequently had an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on 12/05/2019 and pathology results revealed grade 2 ER-positive, PR-positive DCIS. The patient then had a lumpectomy with lymphadenectomy performed on 01/20/2020. The tumor was 8 mm with negative margins and the 5 lymph nodes removed were all benign. Pathology from the tumor confirmed DCIS. Her lumpectomy was followed by adjuvant radiation therapy. Endocrine therapy was also offered but the patient declined. She has since had a mammogram in 01/2021 which was normal. The patient also reports that she performs self-breast exams regularly at home.

Mrs. Brown is a G5P5 female and estimates that her last menstrual period was approximately 30 years ago. She is not currently and has never been on hormone replacement therapy.

The patient’s last colonoscopy was done in 2018. She had a sigmoid polypectomy at that time and pathology showed a tubular adenoma.

Her cholesterol was recently noted to be elevated and the patient reports that she is exercising and reducing fatty food intake accordingly. This is being followed by her primary care provider.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Sophia Brown is a 75 y.o. female who presents today for a new patient evaluation due to her history of right DCIS. She is doing well but wishes to establish care today for continued monitoring.

The patient underwent a screening mammogram in 10/2019 and was found to have a calcification in the right breast. She then had a right breast ultrasound on 11/03/2019 which revealed a mass at the 2 o’clock position, 11 cm from the nipple, in the retroareolar region. The report states the mass was 0.4 by 2.0 by 3.0 centimeters. She subsequently had an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on 12/05/2019 and pathology results revealed grade 2 ER-positive, PR-positive DCIS. The patient then had a lumpectomy with lymphadenectomy performed on 01/20/2020. The tumor was 8 mm with negative margins and the 5 lymph nodes removed were all benign. Pathology from the tumor confirmed DCIS. Her lumpectomy was followed by adjuvant radiation therapy. Endocrine therapy was also offered but the patient declined. She has since had a mammogram in 01/2021 which was normal. The patient also reports that she performs self-breast exams regularly at home.

Mrs. Brown is a G5P5 female and estimates that her last menstrual period was approximately 30 years ago. She is not currently and has never been on hormone replacement therapy.

Right hip pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Elizabeth Reyes is a 56-year-old female who presents for the evaluation of pain in her right hip and groin region. Her symptoms started on 02/2020 and has progressively worsened. She is employed as an RN and notes that her symptoms began while she was working and walking around the infusion room at Johnson. Initially the pain would only happen when she took a step back, but the pain has progressed and now occurs with any type of movement involving her right hip and groin. She describes that her hip will sometimes “catch” when she moves, causing her to fall on occasion. The pain improves when she is still and stops moving. She rates her pain as 2-7/10.

Starting in 2018, the patient intentionally lost 110 pounds through Weight Watchers. She has maintained the weight loss and her weight has been stabile for the past 1 year. She has a history of several bulging discs, but the pain has significantly reduced due to her weight loss. Today, she reports no back pain.

She denies fever, chills, new onset of bowel or bladder dysfunction, tingling or numbness.

RESULTS

MR arthrogram of the right hip completed on 06/03/2021 reveals evidence of high-grade chondromalacia involving the anterosuperior right acetabulum with subchondral marrow edema and cyst formation.

ASSESSMENT

• Right hip degenerative joint disease.

PLAN

I discussed the clinical and radiological findings with the patient. Treatment options discussed are low impact exercises, use of analgesics as needed, and use of a cane to offload the right hip. She would like to proceed with a cortisone injection into her right hip joint. We will administer the injection today. I reviewed the procedure in detail, including the risks of the injection related to the use of steroid in the COVID setting. She understands the risks and would like to proceed with the injection.

INSTRUCTIONS

Schedule a follow up appointment in 3 months to assess her pain. If needed, a second injection may be administered.

Motor bulk and tone are normal in both lower extremities. Motor strength testing reveals no focal motor weakness in the lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ throughout. No focal sensory deficit is noted.

RESULTS

MR arthrogram of the right hip completed on 06/03/2021 reveals evidence of high-grade chondromalacia involving the anterosuperior right acetabulum with subchondral marrow edema and cyst formation.

ASSESSMENT

• Right hip degenerative joint disease.

PLAN

I discussed the clinical and radiological findings with the patient. Treatment options discussed are low impact exercises, use of analgesics as needed, and use of a cane to offload the right hip. She would like to proceed with a cortisone injection into her right hip joint. We will administer the injection today. I reviewed the procedure in detail, including the risks of the injection related to the use of steroid in the COVID setting. She understands the risks and would like to proceed with the injection.

INSTRUCTIONS

Schedule a follow up appointment in 3 months to assess her pain. If needed, a second injection may be administered.

Right hip pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Elizabeth Reyes is a 56-year-old female who presents for the evaluation of pain in her right hip and groin region. Her symptoms started on 02/2020 and has progressively worsened. She is employed as an RN and notes that her symptoms began while she was working and walking around the infusion room at Johnson. Initially the pain would only happen when she took a step back, but the pain has progressed and now occurs with any type of movement involving her right hip and groin. She describes that her hip will sometimes “catch” when she moves, causing her to fall on occasion. The pain improves when she is still and stops moving. She rates her pain as 2-7/10.

Starting in 2018, the patient intentionally lost 110 pounds through Weight Watchers. She has maintained the weight loss and her weight has been stabile for the past 1 year. She has a history of several bulging discs, but the pain has significantly reduced due to her weight loss. Today, she reports no back pain.

She denies fever, chills, new onset of bowel or bladder dysfunction, tingling or numbness.

ASSESSMENT

• Right hip degenerative joint disease.

PLAN

I discussed the clinical and radiological findings with the patient. Treatment options discussed are low impact exercises, use of analgesics as needed, and use of a cane to offload the right hip. She would like to proceed with a cortisone injection into her right hip joint. We will administer the injection today. I reviewed the procedure in detail, including the risks of the injection related to the use of steroid in the COVID setting. She understands the risks and would like to proceed with the injection.

INSTRUCTIONS

Schedule a follow up appointment in 3 months to assess her pain. If needed, a second injection may be administered.

Right hip pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Elizabeth Reyes is a 56-year-old female who presents for the evaluation of pain in her right hip and groin region. Her symptoms started on 02/2020 and has progressively worsened. She is employed as an RN and notes that her symptoms began while she was working and walking around the infusion room at Johnson. Initially the pain would only happen when she took a step back, but the pain has progressed and now occurs with any type of movement involving her right hip and groin. She describes that her hip will sometimes “catch” when she moves, causing her to fall on occasion. The pain improves when she is still and stops moving. She rates her pain as 2-7/10.

Starting in 2018, the patient intentionally lost 110 pounds through Weight Watchers. She has maintained the weight loss and her weight has been stabile for the past 1 year. She has a history of several bulging discs, but the pain has significantly reduced due to her weight loss. Today, she reports no back pain.

She denies fever, chills, new onset of bowel or bladder dysfunction, tingling or numbness.

Right knee pain.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient has a history of diabetes. She has been doing pretty good with her diet. She states that she forgets to check her sugars quite a bit.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain and swelling.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
No murmurs, gallops.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination of the right knee: Some swelling present.
- Palpation: Some pain to palpation on the medial aspect of the right knee, and a little bit of pain on the lateral aspect of the right knee.
- Range of Motion: Limited range of motion as well as pain on both flexion and extension of the knee.
- Special Testing:
McMurray's Test: Negative.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Right knee pain.
- Medical Reasoning: I am concerned about a torn MCL due to pain on ambulation and trouble with weightbearing, as well as the pop she heard.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed treatment options today including bracing, anti-inflammatories, and icing. - Medical Treatment: I am going to put her in a straight leg brace and I will prescribe some Mobic. She can start taking that as a pain reliever and to try to get some of the swelling down. I want her to ice her knee once an hour for about 15 minutes.
- Additional Testing: I am also going to send her out for an MRI.

2. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient states that her type 2 diabetes are well-managed.
- Medical Treatment: I am also going to get a refill on the metformin that she has been taking 500 mg.
- Additional Testing: We are going to recheck her hemoglobin A1c.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.",32,1,"[doctor] so, sophia, i see that you hurt your knee. tell me about what happened.

Left shoulder pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Alan Mitchell is a pleasant 69-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left shoulder pain. The onset of his pain began 3 weeks ago, without any improvement. He denies any specific injury; however, he has been renovating his basement and putting in a new ceiling. He does not recall hitting or falling onto the left shoulder. The patient states he is very active and has experienced left shoulder pain before that usually resolves with Tylenol.

The patient reports significant pain with reaching, lifting, and overhead activities. The pain is constant. He states the pain is primarily located in the left shoulder and denies it radiates down into the left arm. The patient also reports difficulty sleeping secondary to the pain. He denies any numbness or tingling in his left arm or fingers. He has been taking Tylenol for pain, which provides partial relief. He initially iced his shoulder but has not iced it recently. The patient denies he has done any physical therapy.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

VITALS

All vital signs are within the normal limits.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neurovascularly intact distally. Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds. Sensation is intact to light touch distally.

RESULTS

X-rays of the left shoulder were obtained and reviewed today. These are normal and reveal no fracture or bony abnormalities.

ASSESSMENT

Left shoulder pain, likely rotator cuff tendinopathy.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding his current symptoms. I have explained that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the left shoulder to evaluate for possible rotator cuff tendinopathy. The patient was provided with a referral to formal physical therapy. He will engage in a 6-to-8-week course in order to strengthen his left shoulder. I have also advised him to take Tylenol as needed for pain. If his symptoms do not improve, we may consider a steroid injection to the left shoulder.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me once the MRI results are available for review and further discussion.",33,1,"[patient] alright, you can go ead.

Left wrist and hand pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

George Lewis is a pleasant 57-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of left wrist and hand pain. He reports an onset of a few months ago but denies any specific injury. However, the patient notes he often engages in repetitive motions while performing his work duties. His symptoms are worse at night, and he wakes with numbness in the bilateral hands. He experiences numbness in all fingers, but states it is the most noticeable in the left thumb and index finger. He affirms intermittent numbness in the left little finger. For relief, he shakes his hands upon waking. The patient also experiences weakness in his left hand. He reports he drops objects and explains “I have a hard time feeling it.”

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient denies a history of rheumatoid arthritis.

SOCIAL HISTORY

He works in landscaping. He reports consuming 1 to 2 beers on weekends.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left wrist and hand pain. Denies right hand pain.
Neurological: Reports numbness in bilateral hands and fingers, and left hand weakness.

PHYSICAL EXAM

NEURO: Decreased sensation in the right thumb and index finger.
MSK: Examination of the bilateral hands: Grip strength is less on the left in comparison to the right. Positive Tinel sign bilaterally.

ASSESSMENT

Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's clinical history and examination today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding treatment options for his current symptoms. I discussed the importance of activity modification and encouraged the patient to limit active repetitive motions while working for the next 2 weeks. I also recommended that he wear a wrist splint to provide increased support. I advised him to take ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours. Additionally, I recommended we obtain an EMG of the bilateral upper extremities to evaluate for carpal tunnel syndrome. The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks when the EMG results are available for review. If at that time his symptoms have not improved with these conservative measures, we will discuss further treatment options including additional diagnostic testing or possible surgical intervention.

The patient states he understands and is in agreement with the plan. All questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

George Lewis is a pleasant 57-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of left wrist and hand pain. He reports an onset of a few months ago but denies any specific injury. However, the patient notes he often engages in repetitive motions while performing his work duties. His symptoms are worse at night, and he wakes with numbness in the bilateral hands. He experiences numbness in all fingers, but states it is the most noticeable in the left thumb and index finger. He affirms intermittent numbness in the left little finger. For relief, he shakes his hands upon waking. The patient also experiences weakness in his left hand. He reports he drops objects and explains “I have a hard time feeling it.”

PHYSICAL EXAM

NEURO: Decreased sensation in the right thumb and index finger.
MSK: Examination of the bilateral hands: Grip strength is less on the left in comparison to the right. Positive Tinel sign bilaterally.

ASSESSMENT

Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's clinical history and examination today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding treatment options for his current symptoms. I discussed the importance of activity modification and encouraged the patient to limit active repetitive motions while working for the next 2 weeks. I also recommended that he wear a wrist splint to provide increased support. I advised him to take ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours. Additionally, I recommended we obtain an EMG of the bilateral upper extremities to evaluate for carpal tunnel syndrome. The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks when the EMG results are available for review. If at that time his symptoms have not improved with these conservative measures, we will discuss further treatment options including additional diagnostic testing or possible surgical intervention.

The patient states he understands and is in agreement with the plan. All questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction.

Right ankle pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Carolyn Jones is a pleasant 38-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of right ankle pain.

The patient sustained an injury to her right ankle when she slipped and fell on ice while taking her garbage out yesterday. This was her first right ankle injury. She believes she heard a pop at the time, but denies any associated numbness or tingling. Initially, she was unable to bear weight on the ankle and required help getting inside; however, she is now able to slightly bear weight but ambulates with an antalgic gait. Ice, elevation, and ibuprofen have been helpful at reducing her pain. She rates her current pain as 4/10, her pain without medication as 6/10, and her pain with medication as 1/10.

Of note, the patient participates in an intramural soccer league but has not been able to play since this injury.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has had several ankle injuries in the past. This is her first right ankle injury.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has a history of playing sports. She played soccer in college and is now in an intramural soccer league.

MEDICATIONS

PHYSICAL EXAM

GAIT: antalgic gait
CV: Brisk capillary refill to less than 3 seconds. Strong dorsalis pedis pulse.
NEURO: Sensation in the right ankle is intact to light touch distally.
MSK: Examination of the right ankle: Ecchymosis over the lateral malleolus associated with trace edema in that area. Tenderness to palpation over the anterolateral soft tissue. No laxity on anterior drawer testing or inversion stress testing. No bony tenderness on palpation of the foot or ankle area. Findings are consistent bilaterally.

RESULTS

X-ray images of the right ankle were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal no evidence of fracture.

ASSESSMENT

Lateral ligament complex sprain, Right ankle.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, her symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex, more specifically the anterior talofibular ligament. We had a lengthy discussion regarding the nature of this injury and the course of treatment. I advised her to keep her leg elevated when she is seated and continue to ice her ankle. She should also continue taking ibuprofen as-needed for pain and inflammation management. She will be placed in an Aircast to help stabilize her ankle, and I am going to order crutches so she can remain non-weight-bearing for the next couple of days. At that point, she can start bearing weight on the ankle as tolerated.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking allopurinol.

VITALS

Oxygen Saturation: 98% on room air.
Blood Pressure: 128/88 mmHg.
Heart Rate: 68 beats per minute.
Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy. No carotid bruits.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally. No expiratory wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate. 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.

Hematology/Lymphatic/Immunology
- Palpation: No enlarged lymph nodes.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Nicotine dependence.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient has a long history of smoking cigarettes. He is currently smoking 1.5 packs per day. He is highly motivated to cease smoking as he is preparing to become a father.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I applaud the patient on making this first step to stop smoking. I reassured him that with absolute 100% certainty that I will be with him every step of the way. I explained to the patient that stress can often be a trigger for smoking. He received handouts today for common smoking triggers. I advised him to be watchful and monitor his stress level, not only regarding work, but also his impending fatherhood. The patient and I discussed coping mechanisms for when he encounters stressful situations. I encouraged him to maintain his gym routine, engage in meditation, and try adding in yoga to help further reduce his stress levels. We discussed additional cessation aids.
- Medical Treatment: The patient has chosen his birthday, as a quit date. On that day, I am going to start him with a 21 mg nicotine patch, and the goal will be to decrease that over time. We will work together to decrease the dosage of the nicotine patch, so there are not necessarily any hard dates in mind. I recommend he change the patch location each day as that will help reduce or avoid any skin irritation that can occur if he re-uses the same location repeatedly.

2. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that continuing to follow a healthy diet and perform regular exercise will help to maintain his blood glucose levels.
- Medical Treatment: We will continue to monitor his type 2 diabetes. Hemoglobin A1c is ordered to be completed by his next visit in 2 weeks.

3. History of gout.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable with medication.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised him to continue to watch for foods that will exacerbate his uric acid levels.
- Medical Treatment: He will continue his allopurinol.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

Smoking cessation.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports a history of type 2 diabetes, gout, and a 2/6 Systolic ejection murmur.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports he is a smoker.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking allopurinol.

VITALS

Oxygen Saturation: 98% on room air.
Blood Pressure: 128/88 mmHg.
Heart Rate: 68 beats per minute.
Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy. No carotid bruits.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally. No expiratory wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate. 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.

Hematology/Lymphatic/Immunology
- Palpation: No enlarged lymph nodes.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Nicotine dependence.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient has a long history of smoking cigarettes. He is currently smoking 1.5 packs per day. He is highly motivated to cease smoking as he is preparing to become a father.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I applaud the patient on making this first step to stop smoking. I reassured him that with absolute 100% certainty that I will be with him every step of the way. I explained to the patient that stress can often be a trigger for smoking. He received handouts today for common smoking triggers. I advised him to be watchful and monitor his stress level, not only regarding work, but also his impending fatherhood. The patient and I discussed coping mechanisms for when he encounters stressful situations. I encouraged him to maintain his gym routine, engage in meditation, and try adding in yoga to help further reduce his stress levels. We discussed additional cessation aids.
- Medical Treatment: The patient has chosen his birthday, as a quit date. On that day, I am going to start him with a 21 mg nicotine patch, and the goal will be to decrease that over time. We will work together to decrease the dosage of the nicotine patch, so there are not necessarily any hard dates in mind. I recommend he change the patch location each day as that will help reduce or avoid any skin irritation that can occur if he re-uses the same location repeatedly.

2. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that continuing to follow a healthy diet and perform regular exercise will help to maintain his blood glucose levels.
- Medical Treatment: We will continue to monitor his type 2 diabetes. Hemoglobin A1c is ordered to be completed by his next visit in 2 weeks.

3. History of gout.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable with medication.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised him to continue to watch for foods that will exacerbate his uric acid levels.
- Medical Treatment: He will continue his allopurinol.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

",43,8,"[doctor] okay, great, so let's go ead and do a. i just want to take a look he. i reviewed your vitals and ovall. they look good. your blood pressure is one twenty ov seventy. your heart rate is sixty and your respiratory rate is fourteen. those are all phenomenal nbs. as i listened to your heart, it is at a regular and a slow rate, but i do not hear any extra sounds, so the is no murmurs as we go through that. now on musculoskeletal exam, you have a normal gait. i watched you kinda walk in he this morning. your strength: i just want to check it when i go ead and i want you to move your leg. okay, your muscle strength is good. you do have a three out of five for abduction of your legs bilatally and that's kinda bringing your legs in. the remaind of your muscle strength for your low extremities is a five out of five. now let me focus specifically on your knee examination. i do not see any redness or ecchymosis or warmth of the skin, and those are big words. i do not see any bruising or that redness. the is no effusion, that's just a fluid undneath the knee. i do not appreciate that any at all. you do seem to have some tendness when i palpate and you do have a positive patellar grind test. when you stood up i could feel that as we went through the. you did say you had that knee pain with squatting, but your lachman, your antior and postior draw and mcmurray test are all negative bilatally neurologically, and your low extremities, your patella and your achilles reflex, are symmetrical and that's good. so i did review the x-rays of both your knees, which shows no fractures or osteoarthritis. so, based on what you told me and reviewing the mri that you had done before you came in, your symptoms are consistent with patellofemoral pain syndrome and this is a really common condition that we see that causes knee pain, especially in really active young people. that's probably why i do not get it when i am riding my bike, forev and ev. now this condition has to do with the way your kneecap moves across along the groove of your thigh bone, your femur. so for pain i want you to continue to take the ibuprofen or any oth anti-inflammatories, aleve or any of those as you need it to help with the pain. now i am going to recommend physical thapy. they will show you a nb of low extremity excises. this is probably one of the best things that you can do and this will help increase your low extremity strength, your mobility and correct any incorrect running mechanics that you might have. do you have any questions for me?"

PHYSICAL EXAM

Gastrointestinal
- Examination of Abdomen: There is slight tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant. No rebounding or guarding.

Pelvic
- Examination: There are no external lesions on the labia. The vaginal vault is within normal limits. The cervix is pink without lesions. On bimanual exam, I appreciate a left adnexal mass. No masses on the right.

RESULTS

CT scan of the abdomen was reviewed and demonstrated a 3 cm left ovarian mass with associated localized lymph node involvement. There is no evidence of gross peritoneal or metastatic disease.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Ovarian cancer.
- Medical Reasoning: Looking at her abdominal CT results, it appears to be stage IIIA disease based on the lymph node involvement.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained to the patient that the typical approach to treating this stage of cancer is surgical intervention followed by adjunct chemotherapy. The procedure and subsequent chemotherapy plans were discussed in detail. Given that she is young and otherwise healthy, I reassured her that I believe her prognosis is favorable based on her current status, however, this is dependent on the final pathology report. All of her questions were answered.
- Medical Treatment: I want to start by ordering several blood tests including a CA-125, hCG, AFP, and LDH. I also want her to undergo genetic counseling and testing to see if she has a genetic predisposition for developing ovarian cancer. I recommend we perform a hysterectomy and oophorectomy, as well as a lymph node dissection to remove any involved lymph nodes. Any concerning tissue will be biopsied and sent to pathology for staging. After she has recovered from surgery, she will start chemotherapy treatment with cisplatin and Taxol. We may also consider intraperitoneal chemotherapy.

aci,D2N048,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Brittany Edwards is a 76-year-old female, right-hand-dominant, female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right foot pain. The onset of her pain began 2 days ago, when she was playing tennis and was trying to volley the ball when she got in front of another player and fell on the dorsal aspect of her right foot. She states that she quickly twisted her foot because she was trying to catch herself. The patient reports that she was unable to continue playing secondary to the pain. She states that she wrapped her foot after the game and iced it last night. The patient adds that she kept her foot up on a pillow and took ibuprofen for pain. She denies any numbness. The patient denies any loss of sensation.

The patient has a history of a left leg injury.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right foot pain.
Neurological: Denies numbness in the right foot.

PHYSICAL EXAM

SKIN: Warm
NEURO: Normal sensation.
MSK:
Examination of the right foot: Bruising of the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot. Associated swelling. Tenderness to palpation of the midfoot. Positive piano key test of the 1st and 2nd metatarsals. Warm to touch. Neurovascular intact distally. Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds. Strong dorsalis pedis pulse.
Examination of the left foot: Brisk capillary refill to all digits and light touch intact.

RESULTS

3 views of the right foot were taken. These reveal subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the 2nd metatarsal with a 3 mm separation of the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases. There is the presence of a bony fragment in the Lisfranc joint space.

ASSESSMENT

Right foot pain, consistent with a Lisfranc fracture.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her x-rays revealed a Lisfranc fracture. We discussed treatment options for this and I have recommended that we proceed with surgical intervention. The plan is to proceed with a right foot ORIF and all indicated procedures. We went over the risk, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery. The risk include but not limited to continued pain, swelling, damage to surrounding tissue including nerves and blood vessels, numbness that could be permanent, infection, nonunion, malunion, failure of hardware, and need for further surgery. There is always a risk of amputation, heart attack, stroke, blood clots, pulmonary embolism, and death. There is a possibility of chronic pain and the inability to get back to the previous level of function. The patient wishes to proceed with the operation and she will follow up with me on the day of surgery. In the meantime, I have recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy to strengthen her right foot.

Examination of the right foot: Bruising of the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot. Associated swelling. Tenderness to palpation of the midfoot. Positive piano key test of the 1st and 2nd metatarsals. Warm to touch. Neurovascular intact distally. Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds. Strong dorsalis pedis pulse.
Examination of the left foot: Brisk capillary refill to all digits and light touch intact.

RESULTS

3 views of the right foot were taken. These reveal subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the 2nd metatarsal with a 3 mm separation of the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases. There is the presence of a bony fragment in the Lisfranc joint space.

ASSESSMENT

Right foot pain, consistent with a Lisfranc fracture.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her x-rays revealed a Lisfranc fracture. We discussed treatment options for this and I have recommended that we proceed with surgical intervention. The plan is to proceed with a right foot ORIF and all indicated procedures. We went over the risk, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery. The risk include but not limited to continued pain, swelling, damage to surrounding tissue including nerves and blood vessels, numbness that could be permanent, infection, nonunion, malunion, failure of hardware, and need for further surgery. There is always a risk of amputation, heart attack, stroke, blood clots, pulmonary embolism, and death. There is a possibility of chronic pain and the inability to get back to the previous level of function. The patient wishes to proceed with the operation and she will follow up with me on the day of surgery. In the meantime, I have recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy to strengthen her right foot.

PHYSICAL EXAM

SKIN: Warm
NEURO: Normal sensation.
MSK:
Examination of the right foot: Bruising of the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot. Associated swelling. Tenderness to palpation of the midfoot. Positive piano key test of the 1st and 2nd metatarsals. Warm to touch. Neurovascular intact distally. Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds. Strong dorsalis pedis pulse.
Examination of the left foot: Brisk capillary refill to all digits and light touch intact.

RESULTS

3 views of the right foot were taken. These reveal subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the 2nd metatarsal with a 3 mm separation of the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases. There is the presence of a bony fragment in the Lisfranc joint space.

ASSESSMENT

Right foot pain, consistent with a Lisfranc fracture.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her x-rays revealed a Lisfranc fracture. We discussed treatment options for this and I have recommended that we proceed with surgical intervention. The plan is to proceed with a right foot ORIF and all indicated procedures. We went over the risk, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery. The risk include but not limited to continued pain, swelling, damage to surrounding tissue including nerves and blood vessels, numbness that could be permanent, infection, nonunion, malunion, failure of hardware, and need for further surgery. There is always a risk of amputation, heart attack, stroke, blood clots, pulmonary embolism, and death. There is a possibility of chronic pain and the inability to get back to the previous level of function. The patient wishes to proceed with the operation and she will follow up with me on the day of surgery. In the meantime, I have recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy to strengthen her right foot.

Kidney stones.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mason Ward is a pleasant 80-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of kidney stones. The patient was referred from his primary care physician. The onset of his pain began 1 week ago when he was in his barn moving hay when he had a sudden onset of right back pain. The patient initially thought his pain was due to throwing hay; however, he broke out into a sweat and became nauseated. He was seen by his primary care physician, who ordered a CT scan and told him that he had a kidney stone. He denies having kidney stones before, but states that his father has a history of kidney stones in the past. He explains that when he had pain, which has now resolved, it would radiate almost to his groin. The patient describes the pain as intermittent after he found out it was a kidney stone. He explains that he has been straining his urine, but has not seen anything. He denies any hematuria.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right back pain.

VITALS

Vitals look good, blood pressure and hear rate are within normal limits. Temperature is within normal limits.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mason Ward is a pleasant 80-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of kidney stones. The patient was referred from his primary care physician. The onset of his pain began 1 week ago when he was in his barn moving hay when he had a sudden onset of right back pain. The patient initially thought his pain was due to throwing hay; however, he broke out into a sweat and became nauseated. He was seen by his primary care physician, who ordered a CT scan and told him that he had a kidney stone. He denies having kidney stones before, but states that his father has a history of kidney stones in the past. He explains that when he had pain, which has now resolved, it would radiate almost to his groin. The patient describes the pain as intermittent after he found out it was a kidney stone. He explains that he has been straining his urine, but has not seen anything. He denies any hematuria.

Right foot ulcer.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jeremy Roberts is a 79-year-old male who presents today for evaluation of a right foot ulcer. He reports an ulcer on his right foot has been present for approximately 6 to 8 weeks. He first noticed the ulcer after working outside. There is no associated pain, however, he feels the ulcer may have worsened from when he first noticed it. He denies experiencing any fevers or chills. He does however experience tension headaches quite frequently. He denies any pain in his calves when he walks. At this time the patient does not have a podiatrist for yearly foot exams.

He is a diabetic and takes insulin. His blood sugar has been running higher than normal and his last hemoglobin A1c was higher than 9. Occasionally he will also experience numbness and tingling in his feet, especially with colder weather.

In terms of his heart disease, the patient sustained a heart attack in 2018 and underwent stent placement at the right coronary artery. He is currently taking aspirin 81 mg daily. He denies chest pain or shortness of breath.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of diabetes and heart disease. He sustained a heart attack in 2018.

SURGICAL HISTORY

Patient reports undergoing stent placement at the right coronary artery.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports he is a former smoker. He previously smoked 2 packs a day for 20 years and was able to stop smoking approximately 4 years ago. Currently he is not very active but he does work around the house.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking aspirin 81 mg daily and insulin.

Respiratory: Denies dyspnea.
Skin: Patient reports right foot ulcer.
Neurological: Patient reports headaches and numbness and tingling in feet.

Heart rate: 60s

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base.
RESPIRATORY: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
NECK: No jugular venous distention or carotid bruits
MSK: Examination of the right lower extremity: No palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses. There is a 2 x 3 cm ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the 5th metacarpal metatarsophalangeal joint. No associated cellulitis. No pain to palpation of the right foot. There is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound.

ASSESSMENT

1. Non-healing ulcer, right foot
2. Diabetes
3. Coronary artery disease

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed that his right foot ulcer is fairly sizable and will require wound care. I advised him that the ulcer does not appear to be healing and that further studies will be needed to assess if he has adequate blood supply to heal his foot wound. He was advised that due to his diabetes it is possible surgical intervention such as stent placement or bypass surgery may be required to improve his blood supply. I also advised him that I believe we will be able to heal his wound. At this time, I have recommended continued wound care and for him to also continue taking aspirin 81 mg daily. We will order an arterial ultrasound of the lower extremities. He will also be referred to podiatry for a consult.

Regarding his diabetes, this appears to be unstable as the patient reports his last hemoglobin a1c was greater than 9 and is now experiencing a non-healing right foot ulcer. We discussed the importance of blood sugar control as this will impact his wound healing. At this time, I have recommended that he follow-up with his primary care physician for further care.

The patient's coronary artery disease is currently stable. It is recommended that he continue to take his statin as prescribed. I will contact his cardiologist for medical clearance should surgical intervention be required for his non-healing right foot ulcer.",50,1,"[doctor] hi jemy, how are you?

ASSESSMENT

1. Non-healing ulcer, right foot
2. Diabetes
3. Coronary artery disease

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed that his right foot ulcer is fairly sizable and will require wound care. I advised him that the ulcer does not appear to be healing and that further studies will be needed to assess if he has adequate blood supply to heal his foot wound. He was advised that due to his diabetes it is possible surgical intervention such as stent placement or bypass surgery may be required to improve his blood supply. I also advised him that I believe we will be able to heal his wound. At this time, I have recommended continued wound care and for him to also continue taking aspirin 81 mg daily. We will order an arterial ultrasound of the lower extremities. He will also be referred to podiatry for a consult.

Regarding his diabetes, this appears to be unstable as the patient reports his last hemoglobin a1c was greater than 9 and is now experiencing a non-healing right foot ulcer. We discussed the importance of blood sugar control as this will impact his wound healing. At this time, I have recommended that he follow-up with his primary care physician for further care.

The patient's coronary artery disease is currently stable. It is recommended that he continue to take his statin as prescribed. I will contact his cardiologist for medical clearance should surgical intervention be required for his non-healing right foot ulcer.",50,3,"[patient] yes, it definitely was high than nine.

There is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound.

ASSESSMENT

1. Non-healing ulcer, right foot
2. Diabetes
3. Coronary artery disease

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed that his right foot ulcer is fairly sizable and will require wound care. I advised him that the ulcer does not appear to be healing and that further studies will be needed to assess if he has adequate blood supply to heal his foot wound. He was advised that due to his diabetes it is possible surgical intervention such as stent placement or bypass surgery may be required to improve his blood supply. I also advised him that I believe we will be able to heal his wound. At this time, I have recommended continued wound care and for him to also continue taking aspirin 81 mg daily. We will order an arterial ultrasound of the lower extremities. He will also be referred to podiatry for a consult.

Regarding his diabetes, this appears to be unstable as the patient reports his last hemoglobin a1c was greater than 9 and is now experiencing a non-healing right foot ulcer. We discussed the importance of blood sugar control as this will impact his wound healing. At this time, I have recommended that he follow-up with his primary care physician for further care.

The patient's coronary artery disease is currently stable. It is recommended that he continue to take his statin as prescribed. I will contact his cardiologist for medical clearance should surgical intervention be required for his non-healing right foot ulcer.",50,11,"[doctor] the is no pain to palpation of the right foot. the is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound. okay, so what does all that mean? that just means that you have this ulc that's fairly sizable with. i think we need to do some good wound care on it. let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan. so i you have a nonhealing ulc of your right foot, so we need to do some studies on you to see if you have an adequate blood supply to heal this foot wound. and since you- since you probably do not because of your diabetes- you are he in a vascular surgeon's office- we may have to go ead and talk about being able to open up some of your arties to improve the blood supply to your foot. so that might mean getting a stent to one of your arties in your legs to open up the blood supply. it might mean that we might have to do some bypass surgy to improve the blood supply to your foot in ord to heal that wound. i do think that you'll be able to heal it. i do not think that we need to do anything drastic. i want you to continue with your aspirin because that will help."

Anna Diaz is a pleasant 29-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right-sided back pain.

For approximately 1 week, the patient has been experiencing constant right-sided back pain that radiates down to her lower right side, as well as hematuria and nausea. Her primary care physician was concerned for possible kidney stones and subsequently referred her here for further evaluation. She denies any pain with urination or vomiting, but admits that she has likely not been drinking enough water. The only treatment she has tried so far is ibuprofen with minimal pain relief. Although she denies any personal history of kidney stones prior to this occurrence, she explains that her father has had kidney stones in the past.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Negative for fever.
Gastrointestinal: Positive for nausea. Negative for vomiting.
Genitourinary: Positive for hematuria

VITALS

Blood pressure is normal.
Heart rate is normal.

PHYSICAL EXAM

GI/GU: Mild pain and tenderness to palpation of the abdomen. No rebound or guarding. There is CVA located near her flank with tenderness on the right.

RESULTS

CT scan of the abdomen was reviewed today and revealed a kidney stone measuring 0.5 cm in size, located in the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.

ASSESSMENT

Kidney stone, right side.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and CT results, I discussed the findings with the patient. The CT scan revealed a 0.5 cm kidney stone in the proximal right ureter. I advised her to drink plenty of fluids, as much as possible, to help facilitate passing of the stone. She was provided with a urine strainer so she can see if and when the stone passes. Given that over-the-counter ibuprofen is not providing significant relief, we will send in a prescription for ibuprofen 800 mg to help with her pain. I'm also going to order a BMP, urinalysis, and a urine culture for further evaluation. Depending on the results of the urinalysis, we may need to start her on antibiotics. I want to see her back in 2 weeks. If she is still symptomatic at that time, we may need to consider further treatment such as a lithotripsy. This procedure was explained to the patient.

For approximately 1 week, the patient has been experiencing constant right-sided back pain that radiates down to her lower right side, as well as hematuria and nausea. Her primary care physician was concerned for possible kidney stones and subsequently referred her here for further evaluation. She denies any pain with urination or vomiting, but admits that she has likely not been drinking enough water. The only treatment she has tried so far is ibuprofen with minimal pain relief. Although she denies any personal history of kidney stones prior to this occurrence, she explains that her father has had kidney stones in the past.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Negative for fever.
Gastrointestinal: Positive for nausea. Negative for vomiting.
Genitourinary: Positive for hematuria

VITALS

Vitals are normal.
Blood pressure is normal.
Heart rate is normal.

PHYSICAL EXAM

GI/GU: Mild pain and tenderness to palpation of the abdomen. No rebound or guarding. There is CVA located near her flank with tenderness on the right.

RESULTS

CT scan of the abdomen was reviewed today and revealed a kidney stone measuring 0.5 cm in size, located in the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.

ASSESSMENT

Kidney stone, right side.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and CT results, I discussed the findings with the patient. The CT scan revealed a 0.5 cm kidney stone in the proximal right ureter. I advised her to drink plenty of fluids, as much as possible, to help facilitate passing of the stone. She was provided with a urine strainer so she can see if and when the stone passes. Given that over-the-counter ibuprofen is not providing significant relief, we will send in a prescription for ibuprofen 800 mg to help with her pain. I'm also going to order a BMP, urinalysis, and a urine culture for further evaluation. Depending on the results of the urinalysis, we may need to start her on antibiotics. I want to see her back in 2 weeks. If she is still symptomatic at that time, we may need to consider further treatment such as a lithotripsy. This procedure was explained to the patient.

INSTRUCTIONS

Right foot pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Elijah Reyes is a pleasant 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right foot pain. The patient was referred by his primary care physician. He sustained an injury yesterday when he dropped a landscape brick on his right foot while doing yard work. He was able to get up and continue working after the injury. He rates his pain level as an 11 out of 10. The patient also reports numbness in his entire right foot, which has been present for a long time. The patient denies taking any medication for pain.

The patient reports he fractured his right ankle 20 years ago. He received non-operative treatment with casting. He has experienced intermittent soreness and swelling in his right ankle since then.

The patient reports surgical history of his left ankle. He continues to experience soreness and occasional giving way of the left ankle.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of a right ankle fracture 20 years ago.

SURGICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of left ankle surgery.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right foot pain, right ankle soreness and swelling, and left ankle soreness and instability.
Neurological: Reports right foot numbness.

VITALS

All vital signs are within the normal limits.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Capillary refill is brisk in less than 3 seconds in the right foot. Strong bounding dorsalis pedis pulse.
NEURO: Normal sensation. Right foot motor and sensation are intact and equal to the contralateral side.
MSK: Examination of the right foot: Bruising on the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot. I do appreciate associated swelling. Tenderness to palpation over the midfoot.

RESULTS

An x-ray of the right foot was obtained and reviewed today. It demonstrates dorsal displacement of the base of the 2nd metatarsal with a 3 mm separation of the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases and presence of bony fragments.

ASSESSMENT

Right foot pain, due to a Lisfranc fracture.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding his current symptoms. We discussed treatment options and I have recommended that we proceed with a right foot ORIF and all indicated procedures. We reviewed the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery. I advised him that this procedure will be performed in an outpatient setting and he will be discharged home that same evening. He will then follow up with me 24 hours post procedure, and again 2 weeks later. I explained that he will be placed in a cast and will remain non-weight-bearing for 6 to 8 weeks. He will use crutches while ambulating and we will advance his weight-bearing gradually based on how he tolerates the procedure.

I have also recommended that we obtain an MRI of the right foot to further assess the ligaments. I explained to him that if he has poor bone alignment or ligament healing, this can lead to losing the arch in his foot causing pes planus and developing arthritis. I will send an order to the outpatient MRI facility downstairs for him to obtain the MRI this afternoon.

The patient wishes to think over his options before proceeding with the operation.",53,1,"[doctor] hey elij, how are you?
[patient] i am doing okay.
[doctor] so i see he that your primary care provid sent you ov. it looks you we doing some yard work yestday and dropped a landscape brick on your foot, can what? so what's going on with your right foot today?

He rates his pain level as an 11 out of 10. The patient also reports numbness in his entire right foot, which has been present for a long time. The patient denies taking any medication for pain.

The patient reports he fractured his right ankle 20 years ago. He received non-operative treatment with casting. He has experienced intermittent soreness and swelling in his right ankle since then.

The patient reports surgical history of his left ankle. He continues to experience soreness and occasional giving way of the left ankle.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of a right ankle fracture 20 years ago.

SURGICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of left ankle surgery.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right foot pain, right ankle soreness and swelling, and left ankle soreness and instability.
Neurological: Reports right foot numbness.

VITALS

All vital signs are within the normal limits.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Capillary refill is brisk in less than 3 seconds in the right foot. Strong bounding dorsalis pedis pulse.
NEURO: Normal sensation. Right foot motor and sensation are intact and equal to the contralateral side.
MSK: Examination of the right foot: Bruising on the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot. I do appreciate associated swelling. Tenderness to palpation over the midfoot.

RESULTS

An x-ray of the right foot was obtained and reviewed today. It demonstrates dorsal displacement of the base of the 2nd metatarsal with a 3 mm separation of the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases and presence of bony fragments.

ASSESSMENT

Right foot pain, due to a Lisfranc fracture.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding his current symptoms. We discussed treatment options and I have recommended that we proceed with a right foot ORIF and all indicated procedures. We reviewed the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery. I advised him that this procedure will be performed in an outpatient setting and he will be discharged home that same evening. He will then follow up with me 24 hours post procedure, and again 2 weeks later. I explained that he will be placed in a cast and will remain non-weight-bearing for 6 to 8 weeks. He will use crutches while ambulating and we will advance his weight-bearing gradually based on how he tolerates the procedure.

I have also recommended that we obtain an MRI of the right foot to further assess the ligaments. I explained to him that if he has poor bone alignment or ligament healing, this can lead to losing the arch in his foot causing pes planus and developing arthritis. I will send an order to the outpatient MRI facility downstairs for him to obtain the MRI this afternoon.

- Patient Education and Counseling: Nature of the diagnosis was discussed today with the patient and her father. I advised eye tics are very common in children and as many as 1 in 5 children have a tick during their school years. We discussed tics can also include things like shoulder shrugging, facial grimacing, sniffling, excessive throat clearing, and uncontrolled vocalization. I explained that essentially they are brief, sudden and involuntary motor movements and that we do not have a full understanding of the cause. We also discussed that they typically occur around 5 to 10 years of age and mostly resolve on their own within a year. Dad was advised that treatment is not recommended as they do not appear to be bothering Karen and she continues to do well in school and activities. Additionally, we discussed avoiding drawing attention to the tic as it may cause Karen to feel self-conscious and increase the severity of the tic.

Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops or rubs.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination: No clubbing.

RESULTS

X-ray of the chest was reviewed today and shows some round glass opacities.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Recurrent lung infections.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient's symptoms seem consistent with hypersensitivity pneumonitis. He is a farmer and has been moving hay quite frequently recently.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The nature of the diagnosis was discussed with the patient. I explained that hypersensitivity pneumonitis could be caused by bacteria and/or mold that is found in the hay. We discussed that when inhaling this, it leads to an allergic reaction in the lungs, which would explain why symptoms occur every time he moves hay. He was advised that it would be best to eliminate his exposure to hay in order to prevent further damage to his lungs, however, if he is unable to do this then it would be recommended that he wear a respirator when working. Questions were invited and answered today.
- Medical Treatment: A course of oral steroids were prescribed today to help decrease his lung inflammation. CT of the lungs will also be ordered today to confirm the diagnosis. A pulmonary function test was also ordered to assess the severity of his respiratory impairment.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.",55,1,"[doctor] alright, thanks for coming in today. i see on my chart, he, that you had a bunch of low respiratory infections, so first tell me how are you? what's going on?

- Patient Education and Counseling: The nature of the diagnosis was discussed with the patient. I explained that hypersensitivity pneumonitis could be caused by bacteria and/or mold that is found in the hay. We discussed that when inhaling this, it leads to an allergic reaction in the lungs, which would explain why symptoms occur every time he moves hay. He was advised that it would be best to eliminate his exposure to hay in order to prevent further damage to his lungs, however, if he is unable to do this then it would be recommended that he wear a respirator when working. Questions were invited and answered today.

Right great toe pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Joseph Walker is a pleasant 58-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right great toe pain. The onset of his pain began 2 weeks ago, however it worsened last week. He noticed the pain worsening when he was at a trade show convention and he could not ambulate as he was forced to stand there as the pain was there the whole time. He denies any specific injury. The patient describes his pain usually as throbbing and burning, but notes it occasionally changes to sharp, stabbing pain especially with movement or prolonged ambulation. His symptoms also include redness to the right great toe. The patient states that he has been ambulating on his heel to keep his toe from bending. He reports that his pain is present even with the slightest of pressure, which he notes is worse at night when his sheet is touching his right toe. He adds that he has been taking 2 ibuprofen per day, which does not provide him with relief.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports that he likes to bicycle ride.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right great toe pain.
Skin: Reports redness.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right great toe reveals 10 degrees of plantar flexion with pain. Pain to palpation of the right great toe, between the big toe and 2nd toe. Palpated a bone spur on the right great toe.

RESULTS

X-ray of the right great toe taken today in office reveals a large bone spur on the anterior aspect of the right great toe joint. There is a loss of cartilage with some arthritis present.

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays revealed hallux rigidus. We discussed treatment options for this and I have recommended that we begin with conservative treatment in the form of custom orthotics. I have also prescribed the patient meloxicam once a day to treat the pain. The patient was instructed to discontinue use and contact the office if gastrointestinal issues develop. I advised the patient that I want him to continue his regular activities.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on his progress. If his pain does not improve with the orthotics, I will recommend a cortisone injection or surgical intervention.",56,1,"[doctor] hi, good aftnoon, joseph. how are you doing today?

He reports that his pain is present even with the slightest of pressure, which he notes is worse at night when his sheet is touching his right toe. He adds that he has been taking 2 ibuprofen per day, which does not provide him with relief.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports that he likes to bicycle ride.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right great toe pain.
Skin: Reports redness.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right great toe reveals 10 degrees of plantar flexion with pain. Pain to palpation of the right great toe, between the big toe and 2nd toe. Palpated a bone spur on the right great toe.

RESULTS

X-ray of the right great toe taken today in office reveals a large bone spur on the anterior aspect of the right great toe joint. There is a loss of cartilage with some arthritis present.

ASSESSMENT

Right foot hallux rigidus.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays revealed hallux rigidus. We discussed treatment options for this and I have recommended that we begin with conservative treatment in the form of custom orthotics. I have also prescribed the patient meloxicam once a day to treat the pain. The patient was instructed to discontinue use and contact the office if gastrointestinal issues develop. I advised the patient that I want him to continue his regular activities.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on his progress. If his pain does not improve with the orthotics, I will recommend a cortisone injection or surgical intervention.",56,16,"[patient] okay, whe i really catching blue going croppy, so okay, we will, we will, i'll. i'll keep working, then i'll find time to do that lat.

Left foot pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jean Martinez is a pleasant 27-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left foot pain.

The patient sustained an injury to her left foot while playing soccer yesterday. She became entangled with another player, causing the player to fall onto the patient's foot, resulting in immediate pain. After the incident, she required help to get off of the field and was unable to participate for the rest of the game. Her trainer wrapped her foot, and she has tried ice, elevation, and ibuprofen to treat her symptoms. with medication, she rates her pain as 3/10, but without medication her pain is rated as 7-8/10. There is no numbness, tingling, or other abnormal sensations associated with her pain.

Of note, the patient has sustained several injuries in the past while playing soccer, but this is her first left foot injury.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has sustained several soccer injuries in the past.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient has been playing soccer since she was 4 or 5 years old. She is currently playing in a local league.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that she has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left foot pain.
Neurological: Denies left foot numbness or tingling.

VITALS

Blood pressure: 118/72 mmHg
Heart rate: 58 bpm
Respiratory rate: 14
Temperature: Afebrile
Oxygen saturation: 99% on room air

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Regular rate and rhythm without clicks, rubs, or murmurs. No ectopic beats noted on auscultation of the heart. Brisk capillary refill, less than 3 seconds. Dorsalis pedis pulse is intact and strong.
RESPIRATORY: Lungs are clear and equal bilaterally.
NEURO: Motor and sensation in the left foot are intact to light touch.
MSK: Examination of the left foot: Ecchymosis on the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot. Associated swelling. Tenderness to palpation of the midfoot. Positive piano key test.

RESULTS

X-ray images of the left foot were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the 2nd metatarsal with a 3 mm separation of the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases. There is presence of a bony fragment in the Lisfranc joint space.

ASSESSMENT

Lisfranc fracture, left foot.

PLAN

I explained the nature of her injury in detail. Based on her exam and x-ray findings, she will most likely require surgery of the left foot, but I want to order an MRI to assess for any ligamentous injuries. We discussed the procedure and postoperative expectations, such as recovery time and restrictions, at length. We also discussed the complications associated with deferring surgical intervention including poor bone and ligament healing, pes planus deformation, and a high likelihood of developing arthritis in the foot. She will be unable to participate for the remainder of the soccer season, but should be able to play next season.

INSTRUCTIONS

We will see the patient on Monday, for surgery.",59,1,"[doctor] hey, jean, how're you doing today?

Jean Martinez is a pleasant 27-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left foot pain.

The patient sustained an injury to her left foot while playing soccer yesterday. She became entangled with another player, causing the player to fall onto the patient's foot, resulting in immediate pain. After the incident, she required help to get off of the field and was unable to participate for the rest of the game. Her trainer wrapped her foot, and she has tried ice, elevation, and ibuprofen to treat her symptoms. with medication, she rates her pain as 3/10, but without medication her pain is rated as 7-8/10. There is no numbness, tingling, or other abnormal sensations associated with her pain.

Of note, the patient has sustained several injuries in the past while playing soccer, but this is her first left foot injury.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has sustained several soccer injuries in the past.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient has been playing soccer since she was 4 or 5 years old. She is currently playing in a local league.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that she has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left foot pain.
Neurological: Denies left foot numbness or tingling.

VITALS

Blood pressure: 118/72 mmHg
Heart rate: 58 bpm
Respiratory rate: 14
Temperature: Afebrile
Oxygen saturation: 99% on room air

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Regular rate and rhythm without clicks, rubs, or murmurs. No ectopic beats noted on auscultation of the heart. Brisk capillary refill, less than 3 seconds. Dorsalis pedis pulse is intact and strong.
RESPIRATORY: Lungs are clear and equal bilaterally.
NEURO: Motor and sensation in the left foot are intact to light touch.
MSK: Examination of the left foot: Ecchymosis on the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot. Associated swelling. Tenderness to palpation of the midfoot. Positive piano key test.

RESULTS

X-ray images of the left foot were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the 2nd metatarsal with a 3 mm separation of the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases. There is presence of a bony fragment in the Lisfranc joint space.

ASSESSMENT

Lisfranc fracture, left foot.

PLAN

I explained the nature of her injury in detail. Based on her exam and x-ray findings, she will most likely require surgery of the left foot, but I want to order an MRI to assess for any ligamentous injuries. We discussed the procedure and postoperative expectations, such as recovery time and restrictions, at length. We also discussed the complications associated with deferring surgical intervention including poor bone and ligament healing, pes planus deformation, and a high likelihood of developing arthritis in the foot. She will be unable to participate for the remainder of the soccer season, but should be able to play next season.

INSTRUCTIONS

We will see the patient on Monday, for surgery.",59,6,"[doctor] okay. now, if it is okay with you, i would to do a quick physical exam. i reviewed your vitals and evything looks good. blood pressure was one eighteen ov seventy two. heart rate was fifty eight. respiratory rate was fourteen. you are afebrile and you had an o2 saturation of ninety nine pcent on room air. on your heart exam your regular of rate and rhythm do not appreciate any clicks, rubs or murmurs. no ectopic beats noted. the on auscultation, listening to your lungs, are clear and equal bilatally. so you are moving good air. i'd to do a focused foot exam on your left foot. so i do see some bruising on the bottom of your foot and on the top of your foot as now the is associated sing and i do appreciate tendness to palpation of your midfoot and you are positive for the piano key test. on a neurovascular exam of your left foot, you have a brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds. dorsalis pedis pulse is intact and strong and you do have motor and sensation that it is intact to light touch. now i would to do a review of the diagnostic imaging that you had before you came in. so i do notice a subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimet separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space. so lem me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan. now for the first concn of right foot pain. your right foot pain is due to a lisfranc fracture, which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones at the top of your foot, whe the metatarsals meet your cuboids. now the are ligaments at the top of your foot, so i am going to be ording an mri to assess for injury to any of these ligaments. now, based on your exam and from what i am seeing on your x-ray, you are most ly going to need surgy of that foot. now. the surgy will place the bones back in their prop position and, using plates and screws, will hold them the while they heal, and this is going to allow those bones and ligaments to heal proply. it is a day surgy and you will be able to go home the same day and then i am going to have you follow up with me he in the clinic. you'll be in a cast and you will need to use crutches and you will not be able to use that left foot for about six to eight weeks. now. aft that six to eight weeks, you will gradually start walking on your foot, based on how you tolate it, and we will see how you do at that point. so i do believe you are going to need surgy. i am recommending this because the are significant complications to your foot if we do not do this. poor bone and ligament healing can lead to losing the arch of your foot and you are becoming flat-footed. you also have a high lihood of developing arthritis in that foot. so what i am going to do? unfortunately you'll be out the rest of the season, but we are going to get you fixed up and ready for next season. if you are okay with all of this, i am going to have the nurse come in and get you started on your papwork and then i will see you on monday morning and we will get your foot taken care of."

The pain radiates to his chest when he swallows. He notes that he does not have pain every time he eats but mostly when he has big pieces of food as they seem to get stuck. Mr. Taylor notes that it has been stressful for him the past couple of months as they moved from the West Coast to the East Coast, so he has been drinking more, and having pizza, and burgers more. He denies any weight loss, but endorses weight gain. The patient states that he has epigastric pain, but denies dark, tarry stools.

Left ankle pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Matthew Murphy is a pleasant 20-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left ankle pain. The onset of his pain began 2 days ago, when he stepped off of a curb and landed on his left ankle wrong. He denies hearing a pop at the time of the injury, however, he describes his ankle as feeling extended and stretched. He was able to ambulate back to his house after the incident but with pain. He denies any previous injuries to his left ankle. His pain is localized to the lateral aspect of his left ankle and can be rated at 8 out of 10 without medication. When taking ibuprofen his pain level is 7 out of 10. He states he has also iced and elevated his ankle.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports that he has been working from home since the start of COVID-19 and enjoys taking lots of walks.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Patient reports left ankle pain.

VITALS

Vitals are slightly elevated due to pain level but are otherwise stable.

PHYSICAL EXAM

NEURO: Normal strength and sensation bilaterally.
MSK: Examination of the left ankle: Ecchymosis noted over the lateral malleolus. Edema is present. Tenderness to palpation laterally. No joint laxity appreciated. No bony tenderness to palpation of the foot. Capillary refill is brisk at less than 3 seconds bilaterally. Strong dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.

RESULTS

These reveal no fracture or bony abnormalities.

ASSESSMENT

Left ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed that his symptoms are consistent with an ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex. The nature of the diagnosis and treatment options were discussed. At this time he will continue to follow the RICE protocol. He will continue to take NSAIDs as needed for pain and swelling. He will also be placed into an Aircast for ankle stabilization and will be provided crutches in order to remain non-weight-bearing. We discussed that it may be a few days before he feels able to tolerate walking. I also advised him that his symptoms will likely start to improve significantly over the next 4 to 6 days.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to assess his progress, sooner if needed.",63,1,"[doctor] hey, matthew, how're you doing?
[patient] hey doc, i am doing pretty good. how are you?
[doctor] i am doing pretty good. hey, i see he in the nurse's notes. it looks you hurt your left ankle. can you tell me a little bit more about that?

Right knee injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Elizabeth Ross is a pleasant 91-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right knee injury. The onset of her pain began 2 weeks ago, when she was downhill skiing. She states she ran into a tree and twisted her right knee. At the time of the injury, she also heard a pop in her left knee, however she denies left knee pain. The patient locates her pain to the medial aspect of her right knee. Currently, her pain level is 7 out of 10, however she notes this can reach an 11 out of 10 at times with prolonged ambulation. The patient states that her pain has been slowly increasing over the last few days. She experiences limping with ambulation. The patient states that her pain lasts for as long as she is ambulating. She denies radiating pain. She also reports constant swelling and stiffness in the morning. Her stiffness will resolve with ambulation. The patient has been wearing a brace and using THC cream, which has been helpful. She denies taking any medications for pain, however she has been utilizing THC gummies, which have been beneficial.

The patient has a history of a right knee reconstruction when she was 14 years old. She states that she was a good gymnast at that time. The patient adds that she has had problems with her right knee since that time. She denies any other exercises outside of intense gym and ski events. The patient states that she normally skis 3 times per week.

SURGICAL HISTORY

The patient reports a history of total right knee reconstruction at the age of 14.

MEDICATIONS

She denies needing medications.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain, swelling, and stiffness. Denies left knee pain.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right knee: Mild effusion. The patient ambulated with an antalgic gait. Pain with dorsiflexion, but not with plantarflexion.

RESULTS

4 views of the right knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures. There is development of mild arthritis.

ASSESSMENT

1. Right knee posterior cruciate ligament strain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively with continued bracing. We will initiate formal physical therapy 3 times per week to strengthen her right knee. Additionally, I have prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg and ibuprofen 800 mg twice daily as needed. She should discontinue the use of her THC gummies while taking these medications.

Regarding her left knee, I do not believe she will need any further medications to treat this. I have advised her to avoid skiing or gymnastics at this time.

4 views of the right knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures. There is development of mild arthritis.

ASSESSMENT

1. Right knee posterior cruciate ligament strain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively with continued bracing. We will initiate formal physical therapy 3 times per week to strengthen her right knee. Additionally, I have prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg and ibuprofen 800 mg twice daily as needed. She should discontinue the use of her THC gummies while taking these medications.

Regarding her left knee, I do not believe she will need any further medications to treat this. I have advised her to avoid skiing or gymnastics at this time.

4 views of the right knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures. There is development of mild arthritis.

ASSESSMENT

1. Right knee posterior cruciate ligament strain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively with continued bracing. We will initiate formal physical therapy 3 times per week to strengthen her right knee. Additionally, I have prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg and ibuprofen 800 mg twice daily as needed. She should discontinue the use of her THC gummies while taking these medications.

Regarding her left knee, I do not believe she will need any further medications to treat this. I have advised her to avoid skiing or gymnastics at this time.

",66,14,"[doctor] alright. so pain on dorsiflexion, but not on plantar flexion. plantar flexion- okay, alright. so what we are going to do right now, i think i am going to look at your x-rays, but when i when i look at the results of your x-ray, i do not appreciate any fracture. what i am noticing is the development of a little bit of arthritis, and that could explain why you say that your joints hurt a bit more during windy weath and what not. so this is what we are going to do for my assessment and plan right. the first thing is, i think you have a strain of your postior cruciate ligament. what that means is what that will mean for you, though, is that we are going to continue to brace your right knee. that's going to hopefully take off some of the stress that you might be putting on it, especially since you are limping. i am going to recommend you for physical thapy. i think it would be an. i think it is a good idea to maybe start three times a week to get your strength back into your knee. i would recommend not skiing or doing any gymnastics for now, and i think that physical thapy will really help, considing the injury that you had when you we fourteen, i am going to prescribe you some medications. i do not necessarily recommend consing gmies at the same time, but the medications i am going to give you are going to be meloxicam, fifteen milligrams. you are going to take that once a day. that will help with the sing and the bruising. i am also going to prescribe you just a high strength nsaid so ibuprofen, eight hundred milligrams a day. you can take that twice a day as needed for your left knee. i think you are. i think you just kind of strength a little bit, but not enough to necessarily require any kind of medication or bracing. i think you just take it easy on your body. i know that you are vy active from what i hear and i think that's really exciting. but i think you might need to listen to your body and give yourself a bit of a break. you'll be able to do seval workouts when you go to, when you go to physical thapy, but let the ye, let your thapist, be your guide about what you should and should not be putting your body through. does that make sense?"
